Here are 11 times drivers went on to race with another driver's number.", "published_time": "2025-12-19T17:48:17.195Z", "url": "https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/11-times-formula-1-drivers-took-another-drivers-car-number.379iPISGJTlWExVciRPnnW", "content": "With Max Verstappen announcing his switch to Daniel Ricciardo’s old number 3, and Lando Norris set to take on the champion’s number 1 next season – car numbers are back in focus. Here are 11 times drivers went on to race with another driver's number.\nAfter four seasons running the number 1, Max Verstappen revealed that he will line up with a brand-new digit on his car in 2026. With Lando Norris set to carry the World Champion’s number next season, Verstappen will switch to number 3 rather than returning to his familiar 33.\nCar numbers can carry a lot of meaning to the grid. Before 2014, car numbers were assigned to each driver based on the previous season’s Teams’ Championship order, avoiding 13 for superstition, but now drivers are free to choose their own unique number. There are two exceptions, with the number 1 being reserved for the current World Champion, while the number 17 is retired in memory of Jules Bianchi .\nMany drivers loyally stick with their chosen number throughout their junior and senior careers, often carrying it into other racing categories too. However, the new clause allows for number changes with FIA approval, and permission from the driver who had that number within the last two seasons – case in point: Daniel Ricciardo and Verstappen .\nWith retirements, returns, and plenty of reshuffles, here are 11 times when drivers took another driver's number.\n3 – From Daniel Ricciardo to Max Verstappen\nRicciardo and the number 3 have been synonymous since 2014. But the story behind the pairing is very on-brand for the recently retired Aussie. Ricciardo first ran with the number during his younger karting days after quite literally pulling it from a hat. He returned to the number in F1, with an announcement and nod to one of his heroes, NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt, who famously raced with the same number. It wasn’t long before ‘3’ became part of the Honey Badger’s identity, even using it as part of his DR3 brand.\nNow the number 3 is set to make a return to the grid in the hands of Ricciardo’s former team mate and four-time World Champion Verstappen. This week, he announced he would race with Ricciardo’s former number after the Aussie and the FIA gave him permission. The duo raced together at Red Bull between 2016 and 2018, and for Verstappen, this change is one he’s been thinking about for quite some time!\nSpeaking to Viaplay, the Dutchman said: “My favourite number has always been 3, apart from number 1. Number 33 was always fine, but I just like one 3 better than two. I always said it represented double luck, but I’ve already had my luck in Formula 1.”\n5 – From Sebastian Vettel to Gabriel Bortoleto\nOnce his four-year reign as World Champion ended at the hands of Lewis Hamilton at the end of 2014, Sebastian Vettel opted to return to the number 5, the same number he donned when winning his first title in 2010, and that accompanied him to his karting success in 2001. The German was also a big fan of Nigel Mansell , so with the number 5 repeatedly popping up, he was inspired to choose it.\nThree seasons after Vettel’s retirement at the 2025 season opener in Melbourne, the number 5 hit the track once again, courtesy of young Brazilian rookie Gabriel Bortoleto – a new era for this legendary number that has seen so much success. It represents big shoes to fill for the now 21-year-old, but how did Bortoleto come to his decision?\n“Because I won Formula 3 with this number,” he explained on Kick Sauber ’s social media. “And actually from 85, that is the number I used to use in the past when I started go-karting.”\n6 – From Nico Rosberg to Nicholas Latifi to Isack Hadjar\nJust one digit higher was what Mercedes ’ Nico Rosberg had set his sights on ahead of the regulation change in 2014. Reasons why pertained to family – six is both his wife’s and his dad’s lucky number. And that luck transferred, as Rosberg won the Drivers’ Championship in 2016 with six on his car, 34 years after his father Keke Rosberg won the 1982 World Championship with the same number!\nJust a few years after Rosberg’s retirement, Nicholas Latifi joined the grid, also represented by the number 6. His reasoning came from his Canadian background, as Latifi was born and raised in Toronto. The Williams driver explained to fans: “Toronto is known as the six, basically if you’re from there your area code for your phone number is either the 416 or 647.”\nLatifi left the grid at the close of the 2022 season, but the number 6 wasn’t off the grid for long. Isack Hadjar chose the number for his rookie season with Racing Bulls in 2025 explaining on Racing Bulls’ YouTube that the first kart his dad bought him had the number six on it, and he simply never changed it throughout his career. It was a stroke of good fortune for the Frenchman that the number was available, and the partnership served him well, as the success of his maiden season earned him a promotion to Red Bull.\n22 – From Jenson Button to Yuki Tsunoda\nWhen Brawn GP arrived on the grid for their first – and ultimately only – season in F1 in 2009, their drivers were handed the highest numbers available. Jenson Button ran with 22, while Rubens Barrichello took 23. At the time, it was simply a quirk of the numbering system, but by the end of the year, 22 had become linked with one of the sport’s great fairytale stories forever, as Button and Brawn clinched both World Championships.\n“I became World Champion in 2009 with number 22, so I have good memories of 22, and I look forward to making new memories,” the Brit said when announcing his decision for his 2014 season with McLaren .\nFast forward to 2021, and the number 22 was back, with Yuki Tsunoda . Admittedly, it wasn’t his first choice – Tsunoda had raced with number 11 during his karting career – but with that already taken by Sergio Perez, he doubled it instead. In an interview on his former team AlphaTauri’s website, he said: “I also liked it because it was the number of Jenson Button, a driver I respect a lot when he won the Formula 1 World Championship in 2009. It’s also a number used by Japanese driver Takuma Sato.”\n10 – From Kamui Kobayashi to Pierre Gasly\nFrom one popular Japanese driver to another, Kamui Kobayashi made his F1 debut with Toyota back in 2009, sporting the number 10. So, it was no surprise when he chose to return to that number in 2014 when he drove for Caterham.\nAlpine ’s Pierre Gasly brought the number 10 back when he joined Torro Rosso in 2017. Like many of the drivers, Gasly also chose a number from his junior days, but he also uses it as a tribute to one of the great French footballers.\n“I raced with that number in 2013 when I became Formula Renault European champion,\" said Gasly. \"I was a big fan – I am still a big fan – of Zinedine Zidane, who was number 10 for the national French team.\"\n30 – From Jolyon Palmer to Liam Lawson\nFor Jolyon Palmer, when he joined the grid in 2016, the number 30 already felt familiar to him. During his 2015 FP1 practice sessions, test driver Palmer was assigned the number 30, and decided to stick with the number for the remainder of his F1 career with Renault.\nLiam Lawson , however, felt a more sentimental pull towards the number 30 – even if he wasn’t able to use it straight away. When he first stepped into the sport as a stand-in for the injured Ricciardo in 2023, the Kiwi was assigned the temporary number 40 by the FIA.\nOnce he was able to choose a permanent number from the United States Grand Prix later that year, Lawson returned to one that had followed him since childhood. The number 30 dates back to his karting days, when Lawson was inspired by a mentor who looked after him and ran the same number. It’s a choice rooted in those early years, and one Lawson has carried with him ever since – very wholesome!\n12 – From Felipe Nasr to Kimi Antonelli\nWhen Felipe Nasr joined the grid in 2015, he opted to run with number 12. While Nasr didn’t publicly attach a specific reason to the choice, the number carried a clear resonance. It was the same number used by fellow countryman Ayrton Senna when he won his maiden World Championship, making it a fitting link to one of the sport’s most iconic figures and national heroes.\nWhen he joined the 2025 grid, Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli also wanted to pay tribute to the legendary Brazilian. “It is because of Ayrton,” Antonelli said of the decision behind his number in an interview on Mercedes’ official website. “But it is also the number I first used in single seaters.\n“From F4 I started to use 12 straight away and it worked pretty well with that number. Hopefully I can carry that on in F1. I was also 12 years old when I joined the Mercedes junior programme, so there is that too.” The Italian also raced with 12 on his way to Italian and ADAC F4 titles in 2022.\n7 – From Kimi Raikkonen to Jack Doohan\nWhen the time came for him to choose a number in 2014, the 2007 World Champion Kimi Raikkonen had a very meaningful reason for choosing the number 7. The Finn explained: “We had to pick up a number, and I just picked up that.” Another classic ‘Iceman’ moment. He added: “There was a chance I took six because I won the Championship with it, but I knew Rosberg wanted it.”\nRaikkonen’s choice may not have meant much to him, but the number 7 was the desired choice for Charles Leclerc and Valtteri Bottas, who had to pivot to 16 and 77 instead!\nDoohan took on the number 7 in 2025, keen to choose something meaningful for his Alpine car. “I really wanted to go with a number that I raced with before,” Doohan explained in an Alpine social post. The Aussie spent the 2019 season driving for Double R in Euroformula Open – a team funnily enough founded by Raikkonen and his manager, Steve Robertson. “One of my idols, a super special person and driver, Kimi Raikkonen, also drove with that number,” Doohan added.\n2 – From Stoffel Vandoorne to Logan Sargeant\nWith number 1 being an exclusive offering to the World Champion, you’d think the number 2 would be a popular choice, but only two drivers have opted for it. Stoffel Vandoorne used it when driving for McLaren in 2017 and 2018, with the Belgian explaining the number carried strong personal significance. “I chose it because it was the first number I had when I started racing in single-seaters – in Formula 4 Eurocup 1.6, back in 2010,” he told the McLaren website.\n“I didn’t choose the number, it was just given to me, but it was a good year for me – I had a lot of victories and a lot of podiums – so it has positive memories for me.” As with many drivers, Vandoorne kept the number outside of F1, with his Formula E car donning the two as well.\nLogan Sargeant brought the two back to the grid for his one and a half seasons with Williams. Once again, the American wanted to use the number from his successes in the junior categories. “I used to run [number 2] in Formula Renault, and I had a pretty good season that year,” said Sargeant. “Number 3 is my number, but that’s taken [by Daniel Ricciardo] so I figured, why not take a winning number from the past and run with in F1?”\n99 – From Adrian Sutil to Antonio Giovinazzi\nAdrian Sutil’s choice of 99 was unique. While he simply chose the highest number available, the 99 has only appeared once before in the World Championship – on Lee Wallard’s victorious car at the 1951 Indianapolis 500. However, that race was not run to F1 regulations, so Sutil became the first driver to race with 99 on a Grand Prix car – a moment of history for the German.\nAntonio Giovinazzi also chose the maximum possible number allowed under the rules. The former Alfa Romeo driver explained how he won his first race in a 2006 Italian karting championship with the number 99, with the only other numbers available being 13 and 17, both unlucky for Italians. He also enjoyed being the last on the entry lists, viewing it as a lucky charm.\n1 – From Sebastian Vettel to Max Verstappen to Lando Norris\nThe number 1 has been reserved exclusively for the reigning World Champion, but there is no obligation to do so, and the driver’s normal number is reserved throughout their time with the World Champion’s number. Vettel raced with it after winning his final title in 2013, before reverting back to the number 5 for the rest of his career.\nHamilton famously chose to stick with his 44, a nod to his first go-kart, throughout his world titles post-2014, a number that has since become inseparable from his identity in and out of the sport. However, the Brit did run the number 1 on his W09 Mercedes for the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as a one-off.\nVerstappen proudly claimed the number 1 for all four seasons after his Championships. After winning the 2021 title, he said: “How many times can you do that? I don’t know, maybe it’s the only time I can in my life. It’s the best number out there. So, I will definitely put it on the car.”\nFor this upcoming season, the number 1 will change hands for the first time in four years – as newly crowned World Champion Lando Norris will switch from his usual number 4 . “It's tradition, it's there for a reason,” Norris told Sky Sports News. “All of us as a team that gets to have a role in McLaren, or my car, will get to wear that with pride. It's all my mechanics, my engineers, everyone that's part of McLaren gets to have that acknowledgement too.”"}

It would prove to be the start of big things for future two-time World Champion Alonso, who scored his first victory that season in Hungary, while it marked Verstappen’s final campaign in F1 – 12 years before his son's debut.\nKimi Raikkonen and Jean Alesi\nAlonso was not the only rookie of note to arrive in 2001, with a certain Kimi Raikkonen also lining up on the grid for the first time after earning a seat with the Sauber team.\nAt the other end of the experience spectrum, Jean Alesi was entering into his 13th F1 campaign as he prepared for a second season with the Prost outfit – and hoping for better after finishing 2000 with no points.\nThe team’s car proved more competitive in 2001 and brought Alesi three points finishes, before the Frenchman switched to Jordan for the final five races. Raikkonen, meanwhile, was catching the eye with some impressive performances during his maiden season.\nAt the finale in Japan, the two drivers’ paths crossed – quite literally – when both crashed out on the opening lap. With Alesi having opted to retire, it marked a lowkey ending to the one-time race winner’s career – but it was just the start for Raikkonen, who would go on to join McLaren in 2002.\nMichael Schumacher and Nelson Piquet\nIn another instance of a star of the future embarking on their debut just as a famed name entered their last run, Michael Schumacher ’s memorable arrival into Formula 1 saw him subsequently become team mate to Nelson Piquet during the latter’s final races.\nAfter an extensive career in the sport that had started back in 1978 – and had delivered three World Championships during the 1980s – Piquet was driving for Benetton in 1991 when a rookie by the name of Schumacher was drafted in at Jordan to replace Bertrand Gachot for the Belgian Grand Prix.\nWhile Schumacher’s race lasted just a few metres due to a clutch issue on the Jordan 191, his strong form through the weekend was enough for Benetton to sign him up with immediate effect, the German taking the place of Roberto Moreno who in turn moved to Jordan.\nGoing up against Piquet did not seem to faze Schumacher, who outqualified the Brazilian at four of their five weekends together. Piquet decided to retire at the close of the campaign, while the rest is history for Schumacher, who became one of the sport’s all-time greats with a record seven World Championships to his name.\nNico Hulkenberg and Rubens Barrichello\nLike Schumacher, Nico Hulkenberg had the benchmark of an experienced driver from Brazil to set himself against during his early days in F1, with the German partnering Rubens Barrichello at Williams in 2010.\nOff the back of winning the F2 championship (then known as GP2) on his debut in 2009, a then 22-year-old Hulkenberg made the step up to Formula 1 in the year that followed. He went on to score points on seven occasions, including at Interlagos where he memorably scored his first – and to date only – pole position.\nThis was ultimately not enough to beat his highly experienced team mate, however, as Barrichello – in his 18th campaign in Formula 1 – scored just over double the amount of points achieved by the rookie.\nWhile Barrichello remained with the team into 2011 for what would prove to be his last season in F1, Hulkenberg did not keep his seat and joined Force India as a reserve driver. But the man later known for his ‘Hulkenback’ era would go on to become a veteran of the sport himself, with the 38-year-old about to start his 13th full-time campaign in Formula 1.\nEddie Irvine and Ayrton Senna\nThere have been plenty of notable driver debuts over the course of F1’s history – but Eddie Irvine ’s first race in 1993 remains particularly infamous after he sparked the fury of three-time World Champion Ayrton Senna .\nIrvine made his maiden appearance for the Jordan team at the penultimate round of the 1993 season in Japan, finishing the event in a respectable P6. Senna, meanwhile, claimed what would prove to be the second to last of his 41 wins.\nDespite his victory, Senna was furious about an earlier incident involving Irvine. When the race leader came to lap the Northern Irishman – who was in a close battle with Damon Hill – Irvine subsequently unlapped himself to continue the fight, leading to Senna heading to the Jordan hospitality after the Grand Prix to confront the rookie.\nThat heated discussion resulted in the Brazilian throwing a punch at Irvine, landing the McLaren driver a suspended two-race ban. The pair ultimately did not share the track for long, with Senna tragically losing his life at Imola in 1994, but their off-track clash has etched itself into F1 lore .\nLewis Hamilton and Ralf Schumacher\nLike the aforementioned Alonso and Hulkenberg, Lewis Hamilton is now one of the most experienced drivers currently on the grid. Unlike his veteran competitors, though, Hamilton did not have the opportunity to race alongside Michael Schumacher during his debut campaign, with the German having retired at the end of 2006.\nHamilton did, however, share the grid with another Schumacher – that being Michael’s brother, Ralf – when he arrived in Formula 1 with McLaren in 2007, a campaign that would prove to be the last for the younger Schumacher.\nAn unforgettable championship battle unfolded during the season, one in which Hamilton – who scored six pole positions and four wins – and team mate Alonso each just missed out on the title by one point to Ferrari ’s Kimi Raikkonen.\nWhile Hamilton’s rookie year had been an incredibly impressive one, the campaign did not go so well for Schumacher. In his 11th season – and third with Toyota – the experienced driver ended the championship down in 16th place. Though it marked the end of the German’s F1 career, it was incidentally not the last time that Hamilton raced a Schumacher, with Michael returning between 2010 and 2012 while his son Mick also competed in 2021 and 2022.\nGraham Hill and Juan Manuel Fangio\nIn terms of iconic World Champions from the sport’s past, Juan Manuel Fangio and Graham Hill are definitely two names on that list – and while the latter’s extensive stint in F1 would see him race right through until 1975, his debut season actually coincided with the last of Fangio’s comparatively short career.\nAfter finishing second to Giuseppe ‘Nino’ Farina in the first-ever Formula 1 championship in 1950, Fangio took the title in 1951 and went on to collect four more during the decade, a record that was not surpassed until Michael Schumacher became World Champion for a sixth time in 2003.\nHis illustrious run came to an end in 1958, where he competed in two Grands Prix before retiring from the sport. The last of those appearances came at the Circuit de Reims-Gueux in France, an event that marked the only occasion where he raced alongside the rookie Hill.\nFangio took fourth place, while Hill – making just his fourth start in a Formula 1 championship race – retired due to an issue with his Lotus. Greater things were to come for the Briton, however, who went on to take 14 victories, 13 pole positions and two World Championships across his career, while he and son Damon remain one of only two father-son pairings to both win titles."}

Read on to find out…\nMcLaren: Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri\nMcLaren are fielding an unchanged driver pairing, as they stick with Norris and Piastri for the fourth straight year. Those two took McLaren to their second straight Teams’ crown in 2025, with both remaining in the reckoning for the Drivers’ title heading to the season finale in Abu Dhabi.\nNorris will be entering his seventh season, having only driven for McLaren since joining the F1 grid. In 2025 he became the most experienced McLaren driver, surpassing David Coulthard’s tally of 150 races with the team.\nAs for Piastri, he challenged Norris across the course of 2025, and is expected to do so again in 2026 with the team opting to let their drivers race and not have a clear No. 1 and No. 2 driver. The Australian will be taking plenty of experience into the new season, after a campaign that tested him both physically and mentally in 2025.\nTeam Principal: Andrea Stella\nStella has led McLaren since the end of 2022, having first joined the team back in 2015. He has overseen their rise from the back of the midfield – they finished ninth in 2017 – to champions , with McLaren heading into the new era as the reigning title holders.\nStella has been a part of the F1 paddock for over two decades, having previously worked with Michael Schumacher, Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso at Ferrari.\nMercedes: George Russell and Kimi Antonelli\nMercedes waited quite far into the season to confirm their drivers for 2026, after reportedly conversing with Max Verstappen . But they have opted to stick with long-term Mercedes stalwart Russell and young gun Antonelli .\nThe former has won two races in 2025, finishing fourth in the Drivers’ Championship. The latter has enjoyed plenty of success in his debut F1 season, scoring a pole for the Sprint in Miami, along with podium finishes in Canada, Brazil and Las Vegas.\nThe Silver Arrows will be hoping the new regulations see them return to dominant, winning ways, having not secured the Teams’ title now since 2021.\nTeam Principal: Toto Wolff\nWolff has guided Mercedes since 2013, overseeing their period of dominance that saw the team deliver eight straight Constructors’ titles from 2014 to 2021. But he will be hoping for more from the 2026 car, after a barren run since the change in regulations in 2022.\nSince then, Mercedes have won just seven races across four seasons.\nRed Bull: Max Verstappen and Isack Hadjar\nRed Bull have opted to change their line-up for 2026. Verstappen stays, but he will be partnered by Hadjar, who has been promoted from Racing Bulls. Hadjar impressed in his debut season, with the highlight being a podium finish in Zandvoort.\nVerstappen will be entering his 11th season with the team, having himself been promoted from what was then Toro Rosso all the way back in 2016. Hadjar is his seventh Red Bull team mate, with previous incumbent Yuki Tsunoda becoming the team’s reserve driver.\nWhether Verstappen and Hadjar can work together to deliver further success to the team remains a mystery, but Red Bull will be hoping Hadjar fares better than either Tsunoda or Liam Lawson managed in 2025.\nTeam Principal: Laurent Mekies\nMekies was promoted from Racing Bulls to Red Bull midway through the 2025 season to replace Christian Horner. The former Ferrari Sporting Director has overseen Verstappen’s championship charge in 2025, with the Dutchman recording a string of victories in the second half of the season.\nMekies knows Hadjar well from their time together at Racing Bulls too, but he does have a tough job on his hands next season to manage a new driver line-up and the transition from Honda power units to Red Bull Ford Powertrains.\nFerrari: Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton\nFerrari’s all-star driver pairing continues into 2026, with Leclerc and Hamilton once again lining up in the famous red overalls of the Scuderia. They will be hoping the new regulations see an upturn in fortune for the team, who at the time of writing have not recorded a single victory in 2025.\nHamilton’s first season with the team has been a difficult one, and he is looking forward to turning the page on a campaign that has yet to yield a single Grand Prix podium. As for Leclerc, after victories last year in Monaco and Monza, the Monegasque driver has also looked frustrated at times in his seventh season with Ferrari .\nThe team will be hoping their 2026 car delivers for their drivers, with Leclerc and Hamilton boasting no shortage of skills between them, with both proven performers both over one lap and on race day.\nTeam Principal: Fred Vasseur\nVasseur moved from Sauber/Alfa Romeo to Ferrari in 2023 and was instrumental in bringing Hamilton to Ferrari for the 2025 season and beyond.\nThe Frenchman has plenty of F1 experience, but he faces a tough task to turn things around after a disappointing 2025 campaign for the team yielded not a single win at the time of writing.\nWilliams: Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz\nWilliams are another team sticking with their existing line-up for 2026, with Albon and Sainz having delivered fifth for the team in the Teams’ Championship in 2025. Sainz bagged two podiums in his debut season with the Grove-based team, while Albon excelled in the first half of the season.\nBoth brought top team experience to Williams – Albon from Red Bull and Sainz from Ferrari – which has made all the difference to the team, who have recorded their highest finish in the Teams’ standings since 2017.\nTeam Principal: James Vowles\nVowles joined Williams in 2023, after a 12-year spell at Mercedes. He will enter his fourth season with the team in 2026, but it will be the first time with a car that has been designed completely under his watch after joining the team midway through the current era of regulations.\nRacing Bulls: Liam Lawson and Arvid Lindblad\nRacing Bulls have an enforced change in their driver line-up in 2026, with Lawson remaining with the team but being joined by rookie Lindblad after Hadjar departed for Red Bull.\nThe Kiwi racer will be entering his third season in F1, but only his second full year and first starting out with Racing Bulls. He will be the senior partner to Lindblad, who makes the step up from F2. The Brit has completed a handful of FP1 sessions for Red Bull, as well as some private tests.\nHe will still be 18 when the season gets underway in Australia in March.\nTeam Principal: Alan Permane\nPermane was promoted to Team Principal at Racing Bulls midway through the 2025 season when Mekies in turn was promoted to the same role Red Bull. He joined the team as Racing Director in 2024, having previously worked at Alpine.\nPermane has overseen a strong campaign in 2025, with both drivers regularly in the points and the team aiming to secure sixth in the championship. His task next year will be trickier though, as he will be managing a very young rookie in Lindblad.\nAston Martin: Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll\nAlonso and Stroll are retained as Aston Martin’s drivers for 2026. This will be Alonso’s 23rd season on the grid, the Spaniard set to extend many of his own records as he seeks a first World Championship with Aston Martin , in a car partially designed by Adrian Newey.\nAston Martin had a difficult 2025 season, with no podiums to show for themselves. They did opt to stop development on the car very early though, leading to high hopes that Alonso and Stroll will have better machinery to work with in 2026.\nAs for Stroll, he will be entering his 10th F1 season, and eighth with Aston Martin (who were formally Racing Point).\nTeam Principal: Adrian Newey\nAdrian Newey will take over from Andy Cowell as Team Principal at Aston Martin in 2026, the first time the legendary designer has held the reins of an F1 team in earnest. Cowell remains with the team in the role of Chief Strategy Officer.\nNewey will take charge of the team for the start of the new era of regulations, with the pressure very much on his shoulders to start delivering results for the team that has invested so much in this project – including putting their new wind tunnel to good use.\nHaas: Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman\nThe American team have stuck with their line-up for a second straight season, with Ocon partnering Bearman at Haas . Bearman had an impressive debut season for the team, regularly finishing in the points – especially in the latter part of the season, once the team bolted on their last big upgrade.\nOcon knows he has his work cut out against his team mate, who will be bringing even more experience to the table in 2026 – although it remains to be seen whether the new cars will suit one more than the other.\nThe Frenchman will be entering his 10th season in F1 in 2026, having previously driven for Manor, Force India and Renault/Alpine.\nTeam Principal: Ayao Komatsu\nKomatsu took over from Guenther Steiner at Haas at the start of 2024, and has steered the team up the order after they finished bottom of the standings in the 2023 season. With Gene Haas still overseeing things from behind the scenes, Komatsu is a steady pair of hands for Haas as they move into the new era of regulations.\nAudi: Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto\nAnother team sticking with their driver line-up is Kick Sauber , who will become Audi next year. The experience of Hulkenberg combined well with the rookie enthusiasm of Bortoleto in 2025, as Kick Sauber recorded some famous results.\nThe most memorable was Hulkenberg finally scoring his maiden podium in F1, the German grabbing third place at Silverstone to stand on the rostrum for the first time in 238 attempts.\nAs for his team mate, Bortoleto managed a handful of top-10 finishes but will be hoping for better on home soil next season, after crashing out in front of his adoring fans in Sao Paulo.\nTeam Principal: Jonathan Wheatley\nWheatley took over as Team Principal at Kick Sauber midway through the 2025 season, having joined the team after many years of working as Red Bull’s Sporting Director.\nHe has been working closely with Mattia Binotto, who serves as Chief Operating Officer as the Sauber brand fades out of F1 to be replaced by Audi.\nAlpine: Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto\nAlpine swapped their driver line-up after a handful of races in 2025, with Jack Doohan making way for Colapinto. The Argentine racer partnered Gasly for the remainder of the season, and the team have opted to stick with that line-up for next year.\nGasly was signed early – Colapinto had to wait until the last handful of races to find out his future. He is the only current driver not to score in 2025, in what has been a difficult season for the team with an uncompetitive car.\nNonetheless, Gasly has managed to score a handful of points, with the Frenchman set to lead the team into the new era of regulations in what will be his fourth season with Alpine. Colapinto will be heading into his third season – but the first where he has actually gotten to test the car.\nTeam Principal: TBC\nAlpine do not have a confirmed Team Principal for next season. After the departure of Oliver Oakes, Flavio Briatore has assumed the role, along with Managing Director Steve Nielsen.\nCadillac: Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez\nNot one but two veterans of the sport will return to the grid in 2026, as Valtteri Bottas gets set to pair up with Sergio Perez at Cadillac.\nBoth have been handed second chances after losing their seats at Kick Sauber and Red Bull respectively at the end of 2024. In front of them will be the job of trying to turn newcomers Cadillac – who become F1’s 11th team – into serious competitors.\nThey’ll also be looking to put a bit of pep back in their steps after difficult final seasons in F1 for both. Powering Cadillac, meanwhile, will be Ferrari engines, as General Motors work on their own power unit, set to be introduced for 2029.\nTeam Principal: Graeme Lowdon\nFormer Marussia Sporting Director Graeme Lowdon will be at the controls for Cadillac’s first season, as they become F1’s first brand-new entity since Haas in 2016.\n“We know it's a huge challenge,” Lowdon told F1.com earlier in 2025. “It's very difficult to quantify what success can look like other than we just have to execute as well as we possibly can and gain respect from the other competitors.”"}

The excitement was non-stop thanks to the final Sprint weekend and entertaining support races. After all the action on track, Qatar has set the stage perfectly for a Championship showdown in Abu Dhabi next weekend...\nIt was a racing spectacle on-track as Max Verstappen stormed to an unexpected victory, the McLaren pair were caught out after their strategy backfired, and Carlos Sainz and Williams secured their second podium of the season. But those weren’t the only stories from this epic Grand Prix weekend – so here are some magic moments you should know about.\nPlenty of paddock padel\nQatar is famously a race with intense conditions for the drivers, featuring high g-forces and even higher temperatures – so it’s no wonder that many of the paddock like to unwind between sessions.\nIt’s no secret that padel has been the go-to for many of the grid over the past few years, and lots of drivers headed to the courts before the action got underway on Friday. Ever the competitors, good friends Lando Norris and George Russell faced off against each other – we wonder which Brit got the win on the court...\nAs if padel wasn’t vigorous enough, Pierre Gasly and reserve driver Paul Aron also joined a number of the Alpine crew in a friendly (or so we think...) football match during the weekend. That’s one way to warm up ahead of the race – we'll be opting for an ice bath!\nCarlos Sainz’s podium celebrations\nIn securing their second podium of the season in Qatar, the celebrations in the Williams garage were nothing short of epic, while Sainz’s P3 saw him become the first Williams driver to score multiple podium finishes in a season since 2015. It also secured the Grove-based team a mighty fifth place in the Constructors’ Championship – a super impressive feat considering their P9 finish last season.\nDuring the heartwarming team celebrations, Alex Albon sent champagne flying and Team Principal James Vowles even found himself unexpectedly tackled to the ground by Sainz’s cousin and manager Carlos Onoro . If his laughter was anything to go by, he didn’t seem to mind one bit – even if he may wake up with a souvenir bruise or two...!\nAnd the feel-good podium moments just kept coming, as Red Bull also enjoyed an iconic podium return – only this one didn’t come from behind the wheel.\nStepping up alongside Verstappen, Hannah Schmitz received a hero’s welcome as the team celebrated another tactical masterclass from their star strategist. Her return to the podium served as a reminder of just how pivotal she remains to Red Bull’s winning machine.\nFlexible(ish) Franco\nIs there a better way to warm up for a gruelling race weekend than yoga with a 24-time Grand Slam tennis champion? Franco Colapinto had the pleasure of joining an on-grid Yoga session with Novak Djokovic during an Alpine sponsor event – although don’t expect to see this become a regular thing for the Argentinian.\nIt’s fair to say that Colapinto may have struggled with the Serbian’s stretches, admitting he “couldn’t even keep up with the warm-up” on Instagram.\nKimi finally getting his Vegas glasses\nIn a moment we’re sure he’s been waiting for all week, Kimi Antonelli finally received the famous LEGO podium glasses from the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Antonelli’s eventual P3 was not confirmed until after the podium celebrations had concluded, as the McLaren duo were both disqualified for technical infringements during post-race checks.\nAlthough thrilled to finish P3, Antonelli admitted he wished he could have been a part of the pre-podium celebrations in the LEGO Cadillac, so ahead of the Qatar Grand Prix weekend – a bit of the celebrations were brought to him. And with the sun out in Qatar, we’re sure he wore those sunnies all weekend long!\nCeleb spotting in Qatar\nIn an epic weekend on-track, the Lusail International Circuit was abuzz with celebrities wanting to catch a flash of the action as the Championship fight took another dramatic turn. F1 fan, and paddock regular, comedian Kevin Hart had the honour of waving the drivers across the line whilst on chequered flag duty on Sunday.\nWorld-class sports stars know a thing or two about the excitement of battling for a championship – so it was unsurprising yet thrilling to see such a high turnout of superstar athletes in the paddock over race weekend. Along with tennis legends Djokovic and Serena Williams, we also saw former England players David Beckham, Rio Ferdinand, Steven Gerrard and Gary Neville, World Cup winner Sami Khedira, and former Olympic champions Mutaz Barshim and Mo Farah.\nElsewhere in the paddock, FIFA president Gianni Infantino, TV host Steve Harvey, models Alton Mason, Adriana Lima and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, TV personality Maya Jama, and actress Jessica Alba were all spotted enjoying the race weekend.\nIt seemed only fitting that a race weekend as gripping as this was closed out with an epic set by rock legends Metallica, who also took time to soak in the action throughout the weekend. The group fuelled the excitement with nothing but pure motorsport ‘whiplash’ – visiting several garages and stopping by to meet with F1 President & CEO Stefano Domenicali."}

After an epic 2025 that saw a three-way title fight go down to the final round, what does the next season have in store? There are plenty of reasons to already be looking forward to 2026.\n1. New regulations\nWhether you are a casual follower of Formula 1 or dedicate almost every spare moment of your life to the sport, you are probably aware by now that there will be new regulations coming into force next year.\nIt’s a complete overhaul of both the cars and the power units, with smaller, lighter machines that do not prioritise ground effect in the same way as the more recent designs. There will be a form of active aerodynamics – where the configurations of the front and rear wings can change depending on where a car is on track – that means a brand new design philosophy is required.\nThe power units are also undergoing their biggest change since 2014, with the same 1.6-litre V6 turbocharged size now featuring a roughly 50:50 split between internal combustion and electrical energy to power the car. The complex and heavy MGU-H has been removed, and the power units will run on 100% sustainable fuels.\nThe increased energy recovered under braking can be deployed creatively by drivers, while there will also be a manual override mode to provide a further power boost when within a second of the car in front (a bit like DRS as an overtaking aid).\nIt all adds up to a new challenge for the drivers, including extra ways for them to find ways of differentiating their performance on track. And, of course, as is often the case with new regulations, it could lead to a shake-up of the competitive order between teams.\n2. Four World Champions on the grid\nFor the first time in four years, there will be four drivers’ champions on the same grid, just one shy of the all-time record. Lando Norris joins Lewis Hamilton , Max Verstappen and Fernando Alonso as those racing with a title already under their belts, making for a combined 14 championships between them.\nHaving joined that exclusive club, will we see a change in Norris? The McLaren driver admits he proved himself wrong at times during the 2025 season, as doubts crept in over his ability to win a title, but he is now set to carry the iconic number 1 on his car in the coming year, and becomes the driver that everyone is trying to beat.\n3. A potentially amazing driver market\nThere was very little movement in terms of the driver market between the 2025 and 2026 seasons, with a number of drivers already contracted into the new regulations. Red Bull and Racing Bulls will see partially different line-ups next year, while Cadillac bring a whole new pair of seats to the grid. But over the coming season, things could become a lot more active.\nA number of the drivers are understood to have contracts that either expire at the end of 2026, or feature clauses that could be invoked at that stage. The biggest player in the market could be Max Verstappen, who found himself at the centre of speculation relating to his future during 2025 but committed to stay with Red Bull for at least another year. The new car’s performance could be a deciding factor in whether he has the chance to look elsewhere should the wish.\nMercedes took a long time to confirm their driver line-up for next season and only officially stated George Russell and Kimi Antonelli are locked in for 2026, while Aston Martin could have two openings that are likely to prove very attractive.\nAs many as three quarters of the seats could be up for discussion, and while that doesn’t guarantee movement, it usually leads to plenty of intrigue when it comes to the driver market.\n4. A new race in Madrid\nParty like it’s 2012, we’re going to have two races in different Spanish cities next year. Barcelona remains on the calendar in 2026 – under the title of the Barcelona-Catalunya Grand Prix – and will be joined by Madrid , as the Spanish Grand Prix officially moves homes.\nThe new venue is set to be a thrilling mix of street circuit challenges and high-speed sections, with a banked turn called ‘La Monumental’ featuring a 24% banking gradient and grandstands all around the outside as drivers tackle the half-kilometre section. There are also significant elevation changes, as the Madring track makes use of public roads around the IFEMA Madrid exhibition centre as well as permanent segments.\nA brand new track on the schedule often provides excitement as drivers have no prior knowledge of the venue, and all have to work out the tips and tricks required to get the most out of a lap as quickly as possible.\n5. Big new arrivals\nLong before we reach Madrid in September, there will have been some significant new arrivals on the competitor side, as the grid expands to 22 cars and new partnerships come into effect.\nFrom a team point of view, there will be a brand new entrant in Cadillac , with the American outfit gearing up for their first year of racing. With facilities in Indianapolis, Charlotte and Silverstone, Cadillac have a footprint in a number of iconic motorsport locations, but also have to get the logistical side of the team operating effectively at the same time as building up much of their infrastructure.\nCadillac might be a new name on the grid, but they bring with them two familiar drivers, with Sergio Perez and Valtteri Bottas making up an extremely experienced – and successful – driver line-up, under the guidance of team principal Graeme Lowdon and CEO Dan Towriss.\nThey are not the only American arrival, though, as another massive automotive name returns to the grid. Ford will partner with Red Bull Powertrains, bringing their battery technology expertise to the table as Red Bull become a power unit manufacturer for the first time.\nThat represents a new power unit supplier on the grid, and they are not the alone as Audi also enter in 2026. Taking over the Sauber team, Audi will have their own power unit having spent years preparing for the entry as a full constructor.\nThe German car giant have set a target of fighting for championships five years into the project, and it will be fascinating to see where all of the new arrivals start from.\n6. Aston Martin x Honda\nOn top of the new additions to the grid, there are some new partnerships to get excited about that involve brands already in the sport.\nHonda officially withdrew in 2021 but then continued to support Red Bull through to the new set of power unit regulations, when they return as a full manufacturer with Aston Martin. Given Honda’s success in the most recent era, it is already a formidable pairing, but add in the arrival of Adrian Newey at Aston Martin and the ingredients are in place for a big jump up the grid.\nNewey is now team principal, and Aston Martin have spectacular facilities to go alongside their impressive partner list, as they look to take advantage of the change in regulations to become championship contenders in the near future.\nIf Newey and Honda work their magic once again, could Fernando Alonso be chasing a third world title at the age of 45?\n7. Lindblad and Hadjar\nFrom the most experienced driver on the grid to the newest arrival, there’s another exciting young talent to keep an eye on in 2026.\nArvid Lindblad steps up into a race seat with Racing Bulls having impressed during a rapid rise through the junior ranks – he was still karting as recently as 2022. Fourth in his rookie Formula 3 season was followed by sixth in the Formula 2 standings last year, and a Formula Regional Oceania championship victory helped secure his Super Licence to race alongside Liam Lawson .\nThe British-Swedish driver – who is also of Indian heritage – takes the seat vacated by Isack Hadjar , who becomes the latest to take on the challenge of partnering Max Verstappen at Red Bull.\nHadjar earned the drive with an impressive rookie season that included a podium at Zandvoort, and how he performs next to the four-time World Champion will be one of the many storylines to keep an eye on, with the potential for so much more driver movement in 12 months’ time."}

The energy was palpable all weekend long, and with all the action on and off-track, Yas Marina never fails to close out the season in an epic fashion.\nDespite the best efforts from Max Verstappen , his Grand Prix win was not enough to claim his fifth world title, as Lando Norris secured his maiden championship by finishing P3. There was plenty to talk about on track, with penalties, team tactics and overtakes galore – but those weren’t the only stories from this epic weekend. Here are some magic moments you should know about from the season finale.\nChampionship celebrations\nYou never forget your first world title – and Norris certainly won’t be forgetting this one. In his seventh Formula 1 season, the Brit finally became a World Champion in Abu Dhabi, and the emotion hit him as soon as he took the chequered flag!\nAs he climbed out of the cockpit, his parents, Cisca and Adam, were already there waiting for him, who could barely contain their pride. Then came Verstappen and Oscar Piastri , his title rivals all year long, offering genuine smiles and warm embraces – a heartwarming moment from each competitor after such a hard-fought season.\nBut things really kicked off when Lando made it back to the McLaren garage, where the team launched straight into full celebration mode, drenching him with an avalanche of champagne. We hope someone fetched him a towel!\nAnd because no British celebration is complete without it, the night ended with videos circulating of Norris belting out “We are the Champions” and “Sweet Caroline” in a club, sat on shoulders, arms aloft. A perfect finale to an unforgettable day.\nWholesome moments at the drivers’ annual dinner\nIf you follow any of the drivers on social media, then we’re almost certain you won’t have missed this! Before the on-track tension of the season finale kicked in, the grid kept up what’s fast becoming a tradition: the annual drivers’ dinner. Nearly the full grid turned out for a relaxed evening dining together as a last chance to catch-up before the pressure of the final race takes over.\nThe now-iconic group photo made its annual return too, flooding everyone’s social media feeds as each driver posted the same shot with their own spin on the caption. Norris reassured everyone that no food was thrown, Yuki Tsunoda bemoaned some of the drivers missing the white shirt memo, and Alex Albon joked about the grid making bets for the title.\nThe dinner has happened every year since 2022 – serving as a wholesome reminder that even at the most high-stakes weekend of the year, there’s still room for a little camaraderie in the paddock.\nEmotional goodbyes\nAbu Dhabi has a way of blending end of season celebrations with nostalgia, and the 2025 finale leaned fully into both. Beyond the title fight wrapping up and the final race drama, teams and fans took some moments to say farewell to a few familiar faces and eras coming to an end.\nA new chapter for Tsunoda\nSunday’s Grand Prix is the last time we’ll see the #22 on the grid for a little while, as Abu Dhabi marked Tsunoda’s final race before stepping into a reserve role for the team in 2026. Tsunoda even had the support of some of his biggest fans who joined him in the garage ahead of lights out.\nOne of the most heartwarming moments from the weekend came post-race, when Tsunoda performed a helmet swap with his best friend on the grid, Pierre Gasly – we’re sure there wasn’t a dry eye in the house!\nAnd to top it off, actor Jason Statham and model Emily Ratajkowski joined the Japanese driver on Sunday to give him the send-off he deserves – and we can’t tell who was more star-struck! Taking on the role of the third driver next season, Tsunoda will be around the paddock next season, and we are already looking forward to seeing him!\nThe Sauber era comes to a close\nIt wasn’t just drivers saying goodbye in Abu Dhabi – this weekend also marked the end of the Sauber name in F1. After their debut in 1993, the team has taken some different identities during its three decade-long involvement in the sport, with countless races, iconic drivers and a legacy that stretches far beyond its most recent stint as the glowing green of Kick Sauber .\nThe team marked their final race by welcoming founder Peter Sauber to the garage for one last time with the Sauber name, as they go on to prepare over the winter to step into their new chapter as Audi .\nMercedes bid farewell to Bottas (again)\nAnd speaking of familiar faces we’ve loved having around… Valtteri Bottas has been just as present in the paddock this year – not only in his crucial role as Mercedes ’ reserve driver, but as one of the grid’s most reliable comedic sources. Few people can deliver a simulator session by night and a perfectly timed meme by day quite like Valtteri.\nThe team used the finale to celebrate the eccentric Finn before he heads to Cadillac for 2026, and of course in true Valtteri style, it was pure social media gold. There was one last Valtteri Explains instalment, a full slate of media work, a perfectly timed photobomb during the team photo, and of course, getting thrown into the harbour post-race. Peak Valtteri behaviour that we hope continues right into his time at Cadillac.\nGoodbye, DRS\nAnd finally, there was a surprisingly emotional farewell to… DRS. After over a decade of helping deliver some of the biggest overtakes in recent F1 history, Abu Dhabi marked its final outing before the brand-new regulations shake things up next season. Teams embraced the moment with playful tributes across social media in the form of some surprisingly emotional farewell videos – with Kimi Antonelli having the honour of being the last one to open his rear wing .\nFP1 rookie radio chaos\nNine rookies jumped into the cars for FP1 in Abu Dhabi – and with nine new voices on the radio, chaos was practically guaranteed... Names were mixed up, engineers made some interesting improvisations, and the airwaves quickly turned into some of the most memorable moments of the weekend.\nAt Ferrari , the team were quite literally seeing double as Arthur Leclerc joined his older brother Charles Leclerc for the session. Some engineers quickly realised that two Leclerc's could get a little confusing for their drivers, so had to get creative. Verstappen’s engineer Gianpiero Lambiase took the most logical route, calling Arthur “Leclerc Junior,” which the Dutchman (and us) found highly amusing. Later on, things escalated further when Gabriel Bortoleto ’s engineer Jose Manuel Lopez casually referred to Charles as “the big Leclerc.” Yes – it was that kind of day.\nAnd the sibling dynamic was on full display too. When Charles spun early in FP1, Arthur was straight on the radio – but no – he was not worried. “I think Charles is doing some burnouts for the fans!” he joked. A classic younger brother comment.\nThings only got more confusing for George Russell ’s race engineer Marcus Dudley, as he mixed up the names of two rookies, but thankfully George was on hand to help clarify things! Racing Bulls couldn’t help but poke fun at the whole situation... All in all, FP1 kept everyone on their toes!\nDrivers feeling glam\nFast cars, celebrities and high drama – it goes without saying F1 and glamour go hand-in-hand, but Abu Dhabi took things up a notch with the arrival of Cole Walliser’s infamous Glambot. And with it, the paddock became a Hollywood red carpet as drivers eagerly lined up to strike their most dramatic slow-motion poses… with varying degrees of success.\nThere were power stances aplenty, lots of crossed arms, and obviously a Bottas moustache special – the glam bot certainly delivered the goods.\nHadjar household\nIn another incredibly heartwarming moment over the weekend, Isack Hadjar hosted a very special guest in his garage – his dad Yassine Hadjar! The French-Algerian rookie has often spoken about how instrumental his father has been throughout his rise to F1, even honouring the scientist with the physics and quantum-mechanics equations that featured on his helmet.\nYassine looked right at home as he climbed into his son's car, unsurprisingly firing off plenty of questions to understand every detail of his son’s world in a moment we’re sure neither will ever forget.\nHadjar wasn’t the only one with family in his car, as Nico Hulkenberg possibly looked to inspire his daughter by getting her behind the wheel (in the safety of the garage) with her mother Egle Ruskyte.\nA moment for the Abu Dhabi looks\nThe final race of the season is the perfect excuse for drivers to don special edition helmets, and this year was no different.\nHulkenberg reached a huge milestone in Abu Dhabi, – reaching a staggering 250 races over his 15 years in F1! He celebrated with a gladiator-style helmet, and after battling his way to P9 from 18th on the grid – we think the design was pretty apt!\nPurple was the theme for Williams this weekend as they celebrated their fantastic season with special edition helmets for both drivers. Carlos Sainz ’s design even paid tribute to his lucky charm, “Sparkles”, who helped him to an incredible P3 in Baku this season – here's to hoping we’ll see more of Sparkles next year!\nThe Ferrari duo also went all out on their helmets for the final race. Leclerc’s helmet celebrated his impressive milestone of 150 races for the Maranello-based team, while Hamilton marked the end of his first season with the Scuderia with a mirror-styled lid, finished with gold glitter – another super eye-catching design from the seven-time World Champion!\nFrench duo Gasly and Esteban Ocon also marked the end of the season with one-off helmets, completing a sea of spectacular designs.\nCelebs filled the finale\nA title decider of this magnitude was always going to draw in famous names from across the world, but this may have been the most star-studded paddock of the year. Actress Ana de Armas spent time in Williams’ and Ferrari’s garages, before drawing the season to a close by waving the final chequered flag of 2025.\nSports stars were enticed by the drama of the weekend, with those in attendance including tennis players Jannik Sinner and Ons Jabeur, boxer Chris Eubank Jr, former footballers Thierry Henry and Micah Richards with their co-host Kate Scott, ex-NBA players Julius Erving, and Matt Barnes, streetball player Grayson ‘The Professor’ Boucher, cricketer Rashid Khan, and Ballon d’Or winning ex-footballer Ronaldinho.\nIn what proved to be a very musical weekend, rappers Central Cee and Skepta, singers Camila Cabello, Benson Boone, Katy Perry, Sam Ryder, will.i.am, the band Metallica, and DJs Peggy Gou, Adam Port, DJ Snake and Carl Cox were either performing or simply enjoying the race weekend in the desert.\nFinally, there were plenty of personalities from your screens at Yas Marina, including actors Idris and Sabrina Elba, Jessica Chastain, Madelaine Petsch, Jung Hae-in, Terry Crews, Liu Yifei, Marsai Martin, Winston Duke, Song Kang-Ho, TV host Molly Qerim, Bollywood actors Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone, and Yasmin Abdulaziz, models Yasmine Sabri, influencer Youmna Khoury and TikToker Khaby Lame.

But after starting from P4 on the grid, the Silver Arrows driver dropped backwards off the line.\nWhilst he subsequently managed to get back in front of the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso , Ferrari ’s Charles Leclerc proved uncatchable in fourth and Russell came home in a distant P5, marking a tough day for the Brackley-based outfit as team mate Kimi Antonelli was down the order in P15.\n“A dreadful race, start to finish,” Russell conceded afterwards. “We just had no pace – it was a bit odd. I was fifth, which is a result that was much better than the true picture.\n“Obviously Kimi being down in 15th is quite abnormal, for us as a team to be that far off.”\nDespite a difficult outing at the Yas Marina Circuit, it was enough for Mercedes to be confirmed as runners-up in the Teams’ Championship , having taken second place with an 18-point margin over Red Bull .\nAnd while Russell was glad to secure this, the 27-year-old admitted that he is keen to get the sport’s next era underway as a new wave of regulations come into effect for 2026.\n“I think you always want to end on a high, but we had a goal these last couple of race weekends, and that was just to secure P2 in the championship,” Russell explained.\n“I think we’re all very glad this era has come to a close, because it’s been a real challenging one for everyone bar McLaren and Red Bull, and we’re excited for a clean slate.”\nRussell and the rest of the field will not have long to wait for that fresh start, with the first of three pre-season tests set to take place in Barcelona from January 26-30."}

It's kind of a bit obvious in many ways, but that was my best result for the team.\n“It happened in race one, it was a surprise for all of us heading into the first race of the year and it just seems to have created this amazing start to the season.\n“I remember – I think I was P4 on track at the time – thinking, ‘Well, this is never going to happen again’, and then in the end it happened a few more times.”\nWilliams would go on to end 2025 in P5 of the Teams’ Championship with a total of 137 points, a remarkable step forward from their previous tally.\nReflecting on what has made the difference this season, Albon paid tribute to Team Principal James Vowles – who joined in 2013 – as he responded: “I think the culture in the team. James has huge credit for that.\n“It feels like there's really an openness within our team now, a willingness to learn, to improve. There's no ego in the team as well. I can't speak for other teams, but I think that's a really powerful thing to have.\n“It's positive, the energy is great and that's really what's driving this team forward.”\nIn terms of Albon’s own season, a strong start was followed by a tougher run during the second half of the campaign; in contrast, new team mate Carlos Sainz experienced a trickier opening to his year but gained momentum in the latter stages, collecting two podiums along the way.\nDespite this, Albon believes that his campaign was a positive one overall.\n“I feel like I still had an amazing year for most of it,” he said. “It feels like it's not been overnight, it's been four years in the making this P5 and it's showing the signs of us becoming a top team.\n“There's still many more years ahead of us. I think the gap between P10-P5 is smaller than the gap between P5-P1 in terms of performance and where we want to be, but very proud of the team, proud of myself and ready for next year.”"}

F1.com has got you covered...\nWith the 2026 Formula 1 season and another 24-round tour of the world just around the corner, all 22 driver numbers have been confirmed by F1’s governing body, the FIA.\nWhile the majority of the grid remains unchanged, there will be a couple of returning veterans as well as an all-new face to look out for when the track action gets under way.\nBelow you can find all the information you need about this year’s driver numbers, and where the system came from, with a full list available towards the bottom of the page.\nWhy do F1 drivers have numbers?\nSeveral years ago, the drivers’ race numbers in F1 were assigned based on each team’s ranking in the previous year’s championship. However, in 2014 that system was changed, with the drivers then allowed to pick a number that would stick with them throughout their F1 career.\nThat rule was brought in to help increase the personal branding of the drivers, as well as allowing fans to identify their favourite drivers across multiple seasons regardless of which team they would be racing for.\nThat has proven to be the case. For example, Lewis Hamilton has become synonymous with his number 44 – the number he also used in karting – while in 2021 the seven-time World Champion founded Mission 44, a charity advocating for greater representation, diversity and inclusion in motorsport.\nHow do drivers choose their numbers?\nF1 drivers are allowed to choose a number between 2 and 99, which remain theirs for the duration of their career in the sport. If they depart the sport for any reason – be it a retirement or anything else – then their numbers would be reserved for two seasons, preventing any newcomers in that period from selecting it.\nThe number 1 is still reserved for the reigning World Champion, though drivers are not obliged to use it. Last year’s title winner, Lando Norris , has elected to take it up for 2026, while Max Verstappen is switching to number 3, rather than the 33 he previously raced with.\nThe reasons behind drivers picking their numbers can be absolutely anything and everything. For example, Charles Leclerc runs with the number 16 because he originally wanted number seven or 10, but both were taken.\n“I finally ended up with number 16, because one plus six equals seven, and I am born the 16th of October,” the Monegasque said of his choice.\nFor two-time World Champion and current Aston Martin racer Fernando Alonso , his number 14 holds special memories. “When I was 14 years old, the 14th of July, and with the go-kart number 14, I was World Champion. From that moment I had no doubt that 14 is my number,” he said.\nThe full list of driver numbers for the 2026 F1 grid\nBelow are the full confirmed numbers for the 2026 F1 grid, including rookie Arvid Lindblad as he embarks on his first season in the sport…\nAlpine\nAston Martin\nAudi\nCadillac\nFerrari\nHaas\nMcLaren\nMercedes\nRacing Bulls\nRed Bull\nWilliams"}

with the team 12 months ago.\nFerrari\nCharles Leclerc/Lewis Hamilton Dino Beganovic\nCharles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton will both stay on in Abu Dhabi to help Ferrari with their 2026 preparations, following a difficult season that left the famous team fourth in the standings.\nFerrari Driver Academy member Dino Beganovic will also take to the Yas Marina Circuit for the Scuderia after a Formula

position being expanded earlier in the year to become a test and reserve driver.\n2025 Pirelli test full line up\nWhy is this test important?\nThe final day of running in 2025 will offer teams and Pirelli the chance to gain vital data before the end of the season and ahead of a huge regulation change for 2026.\nIt’s also a big opportunity for drivers such as Hadjar and rookie Lindblad to get a run out in a different F1 car, as well as to see how their new teams work. From meeting the mechanics, to how to handle the debrief, this is all valuable learning heading into next season.\nMeanwhile, for other rookies such as Beganovic and Browning, it’s the chance to impress and push for an F1 seat in the future."}

Liam Lawson keeps his Racing Bulls seat while Yuki Tsunoda is sent back to the bench. F1 Correspondent Lawrence Barretto looks at the key questions surrounding the news...\nWhy did Red Bull promote Hadjar?\nIsack Hadjar 's life in F1 got off to a bumpy start after he crashed on the formation lap of the season opening Australian Grand Prix, leading to criticism from Red Bull motorsport advisor Helmut Marko.\nBut he didn't let that faze him and instead went on to build out an outstanding rookie season, which has seen him score points in 10 Grands Prix so far this season. That includes three top-six finishes (which would have been four without a puncture in Qatar), of which one was a stunning maiden podium in the Dutch Grand Prix.\nAs Yuki Tsunoda became the latest driver to struggle to get to grips with the Red Bull in the second seat alongside Max Verstappen , the chances of Hadjar stepping up from next season increased heavily.\nIt's the Red Bull way to get thrown in at the deep end and you either sink or swim. If it's the latter, Red Bull don't see the point in hanging about and would prefer to promote as soon as is feasible.\nWith Hadjar and Tsunoda having such contrasting seasons – and Hadjar building in confidence both on and off track – Red Bull decided he was ready for the works team and didn't need a second season in Racing Bulls .\nWhy did Red Bull give Lindblad his debut?\nRed Bull made Lindblad a full-time member of their junior programme in 2022 and have since been impressed with his progression, so much so they asked the FIA for special dispensation to get his F1 Superlicence before his 18th birthday so they could start preparing him in an F1 car in testing.\nThe British racer impressed across three tests in a two-year-old Racing Bull earlier this year, with his performance in the second of two FP1 appearances for Red Bull (Silverstone and Mexico) particularly eye-catching.\nRed Bull believe he's one of the stars of the future and is now ready to make the step up – and as per their mantra, didn't see the point in hanging about, even if hasn't been a challenge for the title in his maiden F2 season (he's currently sixth with one round to go).\nThe 18-year-old's raw speed, quality of feedback and impressive and mature nature both on and off the track was enough to convince Red Bull to make him their 20th junior to appear in Formula 1 by running him in Racing Bulls.\nWhy did Racing Bulls choose to keep Lawson?\nIt was a straight fight between Lawson and Tsunoda for the second Racing Bulls seat – and it took some time for Red Bull and Racing Bulls senior management to make their decision, hence the delay in announcing until this week.\nRed Bull were keen to give Tsunoda, competing in his fifth season, and Lawson, racing in his first full campaign, as long as possible to prove they deserved to keep the seat.\nIt took some time, with Tsunoda starting to show flashes of a breakthrough – including outqualifying team mate Max Verstappen in the Qatar Sprint – while Lawson has improved his consistency and delivered in some very challenging conditions, such as in Baku and Las Vegas Qualifying.\nUltimately, senior management felt that Tsunoda didn't do enough (he's scored 33 points to Verstappen's 396 so far this year, with three of those taken at the wheel of a Racing Bulls car) while they believe Lawson's form this year, the way he responded to being dropped by Red Bull and his ultimate potential was enough to keep him in the race seat for next year.\nWhat happens to Tsunoda?\nRed Bull are keeping Tsunoda in the family as the reserve driver for both the works operation and Racing Bulls.\nTsunoda will then hope to regroup and either hope to find a way back into one of Red Bull's four Formula 1 seats during the season or the following year – or start exploring opportunities elsewhere on the grid for 2027.\nIn recent years, Tsunoda has been linked with Haas , Sauber and Alpine , while there could be a future opportunity with Aston Martin as he is backed by Honda, who will become the British team's work power unit partner next year.\nAnd what of Max Verstappen?\nVerstappen will be the team leader at Red Bull for what will be his 11th season with the squad – and he's got a contract until the end of 2028.\nThere was speculation earlier this year that he might leave, but he committed to racing for the team next year.\nFor now, he's focused on trying to win a fifth consecutive championship in Abu Dhabi this weekend before switching his attention to helping the team tackle the new chassis and power unit regulations introduced in 2026."}

It was a shame on that side. After that, I think the race was compromised a bit because I was stuck in Carlos’ dirty air, just really struggling to get close.\n“I’m obviously a bit annoyed with that. With two laps to go, I went a bit quicker into Turn 9, lost the rear and went off track so that definitely was a mistake. I need to move forward now.\n“At this kind of track I need to work a bit more, especially with my driving style, but overall I think we took a good step over the weekend. Today I had a good start and had decent pace in the first stint, but it’s just a shame to come away with P5 considering that the podium was so close.”\nLike the majority of teams, Mercedes chose to double stack their drivers for their two mandatory pit stops, but a slow stop for Antonelli had a knock-on effect for Russell, who had already lost three positions on the opening lap to drop back to seventh.\nThe Briton returned to the track in P9 and spent the remaining laps trying to fight for more points. With only one traditional overtaking spot, he was unable to find a way past Isack Hadjar , but eventually improved to sixth after the Racing Bulls driver suffered a puncture on the penultimate lap.\nAsked to sum up his race, Russell said: “I don’t think we realised how much the dirty air was affecting us. I obviously spent 55 laps within 1.5s behind cars. When Hadjar got the puncture, I went one second a lap faster – the difference was unbelievable, and obviously I was close to overtaking Hadjar so it was a pretty boring race.\n“It’s a shame because this track is amazing to drive, but we need to find a solution to improve the racing aspect.\n“It’s fine margins, always. I think we’re close to achieving P2 in the championship now – Red Bull need to win and finish second or third to be ahead of us, so that’s a positive at least.”"}

We’ll see what we can do tomorrow. Realistically, it’s a bit tough this weekend. It’s just not been what I wanted it to be so far, but we’ll see what we can do tomorrow.”\nAfter identifying the issue in the sole practice session of the weekend, the Dutchman has gradually edged closer to the McLarens, turning sixth on the grid to fourth in the Sprint . After passing Fernando Alonso and Yuki Tsunoda on the opening lap, he was unable to follow third-placed Norris closely.\nTo carry the title fight between himself, Piastri and Norris into the season finale in Abu Dhabi, Verstappen must find a way to outscore the Briton in the Qatar Grand Prix, making his start on the opening lap crucial.\nPrompted on his expectations for the race, he said: “I already saw it of course in the Sprint. I don’t expect that to be completely different tomorrow so we’ll see. We’ll try to do the best we can. I’ll try to have a good start and just go from there because anything can happen.\n“I think it was a little bit nicer to drive but still lacking the same things as what I had yesterday and this afternoon. It was less severe but still big enough to not be closer, but that’s our problem with these medium-speed corners.\n“There’s just a little bit too much understeer and you can’t push how you want to, plus you overheat the tyres as well, which on a track like this is almost like a double whammy.”"}

He’s also remarkably consistent, averaging 4.0 in his past 10 appearances.\nOne driver who has also found his rhythm is Carlos Sainz . The Williams racer produced his second podium for his new team in Qatar and back-to-back top sixes. While he has an outside shot of making the podium, he’s showing the pace of the vehicle and his ability to compete with the top four teams.\nThe odds for a top-six finish\nQatar produced another challenging weekend for Lewis Hamilton , as he greeted the stewards outside the top 10. The Ferrari driver appears to lack confidence and cohesion with his pit crew, but despite the hiccups, he’s still finished among the top six in nine races this year.\nAlex Albon also remains a contender for a top six, despite last achieving the feat in the Netherlands. He’s collected five top-six results across the campaign, better than any of his midfield rivals.\nDouble World Champion Fernando Alonso crossed the line in seventh in the last round, his fourth such result this year. The veteran has only made the top six once all season, but he’s constantly knocking on the door.\nRed Bull number two Yuki Tsunoda starts the weekend ahead of Albon and Alonso in the betting, but he’s only cracked the top six once this year and is a better option for a top 10 outing in the final round. Over in the Racing Bulls pen, Isack Hadjar is worth a look, after finishing as one of the first six cars three times this year.\nThe odds for a top-10 finish\nNew Zealander Liam Lawson has found some rhythm in the second half of the year, conjuring up six top-10s in the previous 13 rounds. From youth to experience, Nico Hulkenberg was unlucky in Qatar, just clipping Pierre Gasly and crashing out. That’s now his second DNF in five races, but he’s captured three top-10s in that period as well.\nSpeaking of Gasly, the Alpine senior drove well all weekend and showed immense promise until the contact with Hulkenberg. He’s registered five top-10s this year, but only one in the previous 10 races.\nAnother rookie who has excelled late in the year is Haas ’ Ollie Bearman , but Qatar didn’t go according to plan. A disastrous pit stop saw him lose time and accrue a penalty for an unsafe release. He eventually retired from the race, leaving Doha point-less.\nOn a positive note, the youngster has six top-10s to his name in the past nine appearances. Bearman’s team mate Esteban Ocon struggled at Lusail, but he’s been reliable of late, posting a 50% top-10 return in four starts.\nThe odds for who will be fastest in Qualifying\nThe Yas Marina Circuit plays host to perhaps the most important Qualifying session of the year this weekend; the driver who has started in pole position in the last 10 races has gone on to win the Grand Prix.\nVerstappen and Piastri desperately need a win if they have a shot of leapfrogging Norris for the title. Norris clocked the fastest time on Saturday last year at this venue and proceeded to win the race, and the papaya driver is tied with Verstappen on seven Pirelli Pole Position awards this year.\nPiastri trails the duo with six starts from the front row on the grid. The Australian powered to first place on Saturday night in Doha, his first since Zandvoort.\nElsewhere, Russell has proudly captured two poles this year, but both of them were on street circuits or at the minimum hybrid layouts. Leclerc is the only other driver to win the pole position award this year, stopping the clock fastest in Hungary.\nThe odds for the winning team\nLeading into Monza, McLaren had captured 12 wins across the campaign, which aided the Woking outfit in claiming the Teams’ Championship at the Singapore Grand Prix. Despite a sensational start to the season, the papaya outfit has faltered in the last 10 rounds, capturing only 20% of the victories.\nMercedes contributed one to the cause, through Russell in Singapore, but other than that, it’s been all Red Bull. The Milton-Keynes garage has taken home five team trophies in the last eight races, all thanks to Verstappen. They are also seeking to end their campaign on a hat-trick.\nFerrari have faced a challenging season this year, but we can’t ignore their history at this venue, as the squad from Maranello have delivered a podium-performing vehicle since 2021 in Abu Dhabi. Can they finally come right and grab the chequered flag?\nThe odds for who will win the Drivers’ Championship\nThree drivers are in the hunt to secure the 2025 Drivers' Championship this weekend. Norris is in pole position in the standings and only needs to finish on the podium to clinch the title, while finishing fourth or worse will leave his fate in the hands of Verstappen and Piastri.\nIf Verstappen wants a fifth title, he’ll need to seal victory in Abu Dhabi and hope Norris finishes outside of the top three.\nNorris’ team mate, Piastri, has more ground to make up. The Australian needs to gain 16 points on the leader, which means he can only win the title if he grabs top honours in this race and Norris crosses the line in sixth or worse.\nPrices are correct at the time of publication but can fluctuate.

The lead McLaren is nevertheless still top of the standings with 408 points, a slim advantage of 12 points over Verstappen, with Piastri finding himself only 16 points behind.\nAll Norris needs to do to win his maiden title is finish on the podium at the Yas Marina Circuit, but there are so many situations that could unfold – one involves Piastri running in the top three, with his team mate in fourth just like in the Qatar Grand Prix .\nIn that scenario, the Australian would be mathematically ruled out of the championship, but if he let Norris through then McLaren would still win the drivers’ title, even if Verstappen took victory in the race.\nAsked whether they would use team orders in an interview with Sky Sports F1 , Brown answered: \"Yes, of course. We're realistic. We want to win this Drivers' Championship. We're coming into the weekend knowing that they both have equal opportunity, even though there's obviously a point spread.\n\"You don't know how Qualifying is going to go, reliability, but if we get into the race and it's becoming pretty clear that one has a chance and the other doesn't, we're going to do what we can to win the Drivers' Championship. It would be crazy not to.”\nHis comments come after Norris said in Thursday's press conference that he \"would love it\" if McLaren used team orders, but added that he wouldn't necessarily ask for them as it would be \"up to Oscar if he would allow it\".\nThe Woking outfit have been the dominant team throughout much of the season, with Piastri holding an advantage of 104 points over Verstappen at one stage. However, the reigning World Champion mounted a remarkable comeback that coincided with a drop in form for the Australian, bringing him back into the battle.\nNorris’ victories in Mexico and Brazil helped him snatch first place in the standings, but he will lose out on his first world title if Verstappen wins the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and he crosses the line in P4 or lower.\nMcLaren have repeatedly emphasised their focus on fairness this season, with their 'papaya rules’ coming into play on various occasions, but Brown insisted that this helped them win the Teams’ Championship in Round 18 in Singapore, and will benefit them in Abu Dhabi too.\n\"We want to win the Drivers' Championship,” he said. “So, we'll kind of see how the race plays out, but we're not going to not win the championship because we're trying to protect a third and a fourth or a sixth and a seventh, or however the situation may play out.\n\"It's a team sport, right? So, we're trying to win the Constructors' as a team and we're trying to win the Drivers' as a team.\n\"I know that kind of sounds a bit strange, but if one of them can't win, they want the other to win. And that's what the team wants. And they are team players and we've already seen that last year, right?\n\"You saw that in the Sprint in Brazil and I think it was Qatar. So, I don't think it's unusual in any sport for team mates to make sacrifices for each other to give the team what they want.\""}

He eventually beat his Red Bull rival by just two points, but it was his team mate Oscar Piastri who led the standings longer than any other driver.\nMcLaren have been consistently vocal about how they want to treat both Norris and Piastri equally, offering them the same opportunities to win races, but this has backfired on occasion. In Monza, for example, Norris suffered a slow pit stop and emerged behind his team mate who was running in P2. Piastri was then asked to let Norris through and obeyed, cutting his 34-point lead to 31 in the process.\nAsked whether the pain of implementing that kind of instruction was ultimately worth it, Brown said: “We're definitely committed to giving both drivers equal opportunity to win the World Championship. Even when you win, on Monday, you talk about what you could have done differently or better.\n“We're constantly evolving as a racing team. But the fundamentals of having two drivers that would give equal opportunity to win, that won't change.\n“Do we look back and have lots of learnings?” Brown continued. “I remember when we finished first and second in Spain, our debrief on Monday was about eight things that were close calls that we could have done better.\n“I think that’s the nature of a Formula 1 team – to always evaluate and go, “What could we have done differently, what could we have done better?” I think in sport you're going to win some, you're going to lose some.\n“Of course, when you've made mistakes, you wish you hadn't, but that's just not realistic. I've yet to see any person or team in any sport have the perfect season. So, we're no different than that. But fundamentally, the way we go racing – that won’t change.”"}

Together, in the first season of their official partnership, they launched the F1 Allwyn Global Community Award to recognise and fund local community efforts.\nThe F1 Allwyn Global Community Award, established in June 2025, puts local community-focused initiatives on a global stage, celebrating the powerful, positive impact they have on society.\nIt was designed to provide tangible support to deserving non-profit organisations, charities, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), by recognising initiatives that deliver measurable impact or focus on at least one of the following areas:\nEmpowerment and inclusion\nEducation and opportunity\nHealth and wellbeing\nSustainability and innovation\n2025 saw four winners selected by a rotating panel of judges based on representatives from Formula 1, Allwyn, and the local race promoter. Each winner received a generous €100,000 donation, courtesy of Allwyn, along with a prestigious trophy – presented in front of cheering crowds on the F1 Fanzone stage – and an unforgettable trip to a Formula 1 Grand Prix.\nSee all four F1 Allwyn Global Community Award winners below...\nDutch Grand Prix – Stichting HandicapNL\nThe very first F1 Allwyn Global Community Award was presented in August ahead of the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort. Stichting HandicapNL was recognised for its essential work in transforming event accessibility for the two million people with disabilities in the Netherlands.\nThe organisation’s efforts – which include providing specialised information and upgrading facilities – break down barriers and create a more inclusive society for all fans.\nAccepting the award from Stichting HandicapNL was Jan Willem Koopman, who was presented the trophy on the F1 Fanzone stage in front of the accessible stand his organisation helped implement.\nKoopman explained their shared goal to help people with disabilities access and inclusively attend a whole event, from start to finish – whether that’s an F1 race or a concert – and that the donation will ensure that four additional major events become more accessible.\nUnited States Grand Prix – Girlstart\nThe next award was presented at the United States Grand Prix at Circuit of The Americas to Girlstart – an Austin-based national organisation dedicated to engaging young girls in exploring STEM subjects.\nThe organisation provides hands-on programmes led by all-female mentors, directly addressing the historical under-representation of women in STEM careers.\nThe initiative has worked closely with F1 for years, bringing STEM to life at COTA through hands-on experiences that include robot coding and behind-the-scenes access to race technology and engineers. The young girls even got the opportunity to meet drivers like Lewis Hamilton.\nDuring the race weekend, award recipient Shane Woods ensured that the next generation believed they had the potential to change the world through STEM – and thanks to the grant, they’ll be able to extend their programme with more teachers, training and supplies to reach over 1250 girls in Central Texas – while inspiring even more young girls in the future.\nMexico City Grand Prix – The John Langdon Down Foundation\nThe third award was presented to The John Langdon Down Foundation. The Mexico City-based institution was chosen for its pioneering integrated care and education programme dedicated to promoting the human rights, dignity, and potential of people with Down Syndrome.\nThe Allwyn donation will support 89 children aged six-18 and assist an estimated 445 family members with training and support, aiming to break down systemic barriers and improve social inclusion – ultimately shifting perceptions about the capabilities of people with Down Syndrome in society.\nThe foundation has a long-standing relationship with Formula 1, which has included opening opportunities for its students to take part in fun, inclusive games and activities at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, such as meeting drivers and testing their skills in racing simulators.\nProf. Sylvia Garcia Escamilla, president of The John Langdon Down Foundation, was presented her award by an emotional Federico Gonzalez Compean (the Grand Prix’s Director General), and expressed her gratitude for being able to implement a more integrated support system to foster greater inclusion in Mexico and beyond.\nLas Vegas Grand Prix – Green Our Planet\nThe final award of the season was presented ahead of the Las Vegas Grand Prix to Green Our Planet, which was recognised for its innovative HydroConnect programme that tackles food security and access to high-quality STEM education.\nThe initiative uses hydroponic systems – the world’s most water-efficient form of farming – to teach students how to grow food while mastering STEM, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture.\nGreen Our Planet runs the largest hydroponics programme in the United States, operating in over 1,400 schools and impacting over 500,000 students. Formula 1’s support includes serving as the presenting sponsor of Green Our Planet’s Giant Student Farmers Market, and the Las Vegas Grand Prix team even installed a hydrophobic micro farm at the track, underscoring its commitment to sustainability.\nThe judges acknowledged how its important work could help inspire a future generation of sustainability and community leaders, and were incredibly proud to present Ciara Byrne with her award among the glamour of the Las Vegas Strip.\nLooking ahead to 2026\nThe inaugural season laid a strong foundation for the F1 Allwyn Global Community Award, successfully spotlighting four exceptional initiatives and granting €100,000 per race from Allwyn to create a tangible impact.\nTogether, Formula 1 and Allwyn are actively exploring plans to extend the reach of the award for 2026, with the potential to cover even more races on the calendar and celebrate even more projects that are making a meaningful difference to communities around the world. They’re even exploring ways to integrate fans more, allowing the sport’s global audience to have greater involvement.\nThe success of the debut season truly demonstrates the power of the partnership in achieving global community impact.\nStefano Domenicali, President & CEO of Formula 1, said: “With our shared commitment to positive change, our first year in partnership with Allwyn has truly shown the difference we can make when we come together.\n\"The competition for each of the awards has been exceptionally high and we thank everyone who has been involved, from the charities for their incredible work, through to our dedicated promoters, and of course Allwyn for their vision and dedication.\n\"The winning charities clearly demonstrated the passion they have for their causes, from supporting those with disabilities to improving education and wellbeing. We are confident that they will make great use of the €100,000 prize they each received and grasp the opportunity this award gives them to further raise their profile.\n\"This is just the start of our partnership with Allwyn, and I can’t wait to see the difference we can make together next year.”\nPavel Turek, Chief Officer Global Partnerships at Allwyn, added: “Allwyn is a leading lottery-led entertainment and gaming company renowned for its commitment to social responsibility. Supporting positive impact is fundamental to our purpose and our partnership with Formula 1 is the perfect opportunity to bring our shared commitment to a huge global audience.\n\"It is a great privilege to help these four exceptional initiatives continue their community endeavours, and I’m looking forward to the opportunity to help recognise even more work next year.”"}

Things went from bad to worse as the papaya team elected to keep their drivers out instead of pitting under the early Safety Car, leaving them with the gargantuan challenge of chasing down the Red Bull .\nBy the time the Dutchman had completed his mandatory two stops, the McLaren pair were significantly behind in terms of strategy, despite holding P1 and P2 on the track. Their second tyre change saw Piastri emerge around 17 seconds behind Verstappen, and despite his best efforts, his near-perfect weekend fell apart as he finished in P2.\nOn the other side of the team garage, Norris could only manage fourth position as he failed to pass Carlos Sainz for the final podium spot, although he did gain a place late on due to an error from Kimi Antonelli.\nThe 26-year-old nevertheless still holds a slim advantage in the standings and is on his way to claiming his maiden title, but what exactly does he need to do in the sole remaining race in Abu Dhabi? Find all the key numbers and scenarios below…\nDrivers' Championship standings ahead of Abu Dhabi\nHow can Norris win the title in Abu Dhabi?\nNorris will arrive at the season finale with 408 points, just 12 more than Verstappen. Piastri is a further four points behind on 392, making his championship charge mathematically possible, but increasingly unlikely.\nEssentially, if Norris finishes on the podium at Yas Marina, he will be world champion. It wouldn’t matter where his two rivals cross the line – a top three result is all he needs to wrap it up nicely.\nConditions for Norris to win the WDC\nWhat if Norris doesn't finish on the podium?\nVerstappen would have been knocked out of the fight entirely if he hadn't outscored the McLarens this weekend, but his confident drive to P1 has allowed him to leapfrog Piastri in the standings and increase his chances of taking a fifth consecutive world championship.\nHis turnaround from his unrelenting struggle with bouncing before the Qatar Grand Prix means that a victory in Abu Dhabi, combined with a maximum fourth place result for Norris, would grant the Dutchman the title – a pretty magnificent comeback considering he was 104 points off the lead at one stage in the season.\nConditions for Verstappen to win the WDC\nWhat needs to fall into place for Piastri to have a chance?\nThe Australian admitted himself after the Qatar Grand Prix that he would \"need a lot of things to go in my direction\" in order to still be in with a shot, but the fact that he rediscovered his form this weekend certainly helps his case.\nNorris won last season's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, but if he can't repeat the achievement and has a disastrous race, Piastri would have to rely on some other teams – like Mercedes or maybe Ferrari – putting on a great performance to put some space between him and Verstappen.\nHe can only win the title if he takes the chequered flag first or second, with his two competitors both failing to finish on the podium.\nConditions for Piastri to win the WDC"}

As he moves into a Red Bull reserve role in 2026, let’s explore his five seasons in the sport.\nAfter five seasons on the Formula 1 grid, it’s time to say goodbye to Yuki Tsunoda...sort of. The 25-year-old will still be part of the Red Bull family in 2026 as a reserve driver, while Isack Hadjar gets a promotion from Racing Bulls and Arvid Lindblad graduates from Formula 2. The Japanese driver’s career so far includes 111 Grands Prix, 124 points and a career-high P4 at the Abu Dhabi 2021 Grand Prix.\nWith this change in role, it’s the perfect opportunity to explore Tsunoda ’s time in F1 so far and what makes him such a fan favourite. Whether it’s his exciting overtakes, expressive radio rants, unmistakable style, or his bromance with Pierre Gasly , Tsunoda made a distinct impact in the world of motorsport on and off the track.\nOn-track triumphs\nTsunoda’s rise in the racing scene was meteoric, going from Japanese F4 to F1 in under four years. The prodigy coming out of Sagamihara was backed by Honda’s Formula Dream Project in 2016, helping him join the Red Bull junior team and get a seat in the 2020 F2 Championship with Carlin. Tsunoda looked right at home, finishing as the best-placed rookie in third, and claiming three wins, four poles and seven podiums. A clutch performance in the final round in Bahrain gave him enough FIA Super Licence points to join the 2021 F1 grid.\nIt didn’t take long for Tsunoda to develop a reputation for daring late moves, an aggressive driving style, and impressive raw speed. Franz Tost , his former Team Principal at AlphaTauri, said: “His driving style belongs to the modern driving styles. He knows what he wants – he doesn’t like a car that understeers or when the car washes out at the apex, and he doesn’t care about the rear of the car.” We saw this aggression immediately at the 2021 season opener in Bahrain , as Tsunoda made plenty of moves to claim P9 and points on debut.\nThe 2022 season was hampered by a severe downturn in pace for the AlphaTauri team, and some bad fortune, but provided valuable experience for the then 22-year-old. In 2023 and 2024, the newly named Racing Bulls began to try out a whole host of new drivers, each one Tsunoda was expected to beat. And he did exactly that, getting the better of Nyck de Vries, Daniel Ricciardo and Liam Lawson in the Drivers’ Standings to keep his spot on the grid. He also managed his best Qualifying at the 2024 Sao Paulo Grand Prix , taking P3 in tricky wet conditions.\nHaving earned a promotion to Red Bull within two races in 2025, Tsunoda wasn’t able to keep pace with Max Verstappen in the second seat, prompting the hierarchy to look elsewhere for 2026. However, Tsunoda has still had his moments this season, always driving with the type of determination that always draws fans in.\nSocial butterfly\nArriving on the grid in 2021 as the youngest driver in the field, you might have expected Tsunoda to take time settling into the rhythm of the F1 life – the constant travel, high intensity and the challenge of building relationships in a paddock – but he became a favourite among the drivers just as quickly as he became a favourite with the fans.\nThroughout his time at Racing Bulls (formerly AlphaTauri) and this year with Red Bull, Tsunoda has built strong, genuine connections with every team mate he’s shared a garage with – no small thing in a sport where driver pairings can often move in the opposite direction. Whether it’s been working through some challenging weekends or bringing his humour wherever he goes, he’s consistently created a sense of camaraderie in the garage that team mates and crew members alike have spoken warmly about.\nHowever, there was one driver with whom Tsunoda developed an excellent friendship, or ‘bromance.’ Tsunoda and Gasly got on like a house on fire, and in the two years they spent as team mates, they had many iconic moments off the track. Perhaps the most famous moment was the pair singing Adele’s ‘Hello’ in karaoke in Tokyo. While the singing may not be the best, it’s clear how much fun the two of them had at AlphaTauri.\nThe team’s social media made waves online with their challenges and behind-the-scenes content. Fans enjoyed moments such as Gasly making fun of Tsunoda for getting a speeding ticket, the Frenchman calling Tsunoda ‘Guiseppe’ for an entire year, the guys playing football and video games together, and the pair leaning into their ‘bromance’ at F1 events.\nTsunoda has ended up with a lot of different team mates at Racing Bulls and Red Bull, but he’s had his moments with all of them. He enjoyed playing padel with Verstappen, as well as messing around with him at the Drivers’ Parade in Brazil. Although his time with Hadjar and Liam Lawson was brief, we still got some enjoyable TikToks from the pair. Ricciardo clearly left a lasting impact on Tsunoda, and he posted a heartfelt tribute when the Aussie left the paddock.\nIt wasn’t just team mates who enjoyed Tsunoda’s infectious energy – the Tokyo native left a profound effect on fans, his crew, and even some celebrities.\nYuki’s special style\nTsunoda has always had a creative streak in him, especially when it comes to his helmet designs. There’s been plenty of eye-catching and meaningful lid designs, including his Honda tribute for the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, his Kabuki-inspired headgear for his 2025 home race in Suzuka, and his collaboration with the video game Valorant for the 2024 race in Spa-Francorchamps.\nAlthough he’s commonly spotted showing off the newest and boldest Red Bull merchandise and team kit, Tsunoda still has his fashionable moments in the paddock. From classic backwards hats to stylish sunglasses, Tsunoda is always looking cool between sessions. He’s pushed the boat out with some double denim looks and graphic tees, and he certainly turned heads at the F1 Movie premiere in New York.\nYuki: Unfiltered\nTsunoda may not have much of a filter, especially on team radio, but being unapologetically himself has endeared the 5ft 3in driver to his many fans. He quickly gained a reputation for expletive rants on team radio, leaving broadcasters scrambling for their bleep censors. But these reactions were honest and gave an insight into the passion Tsunoda has for racing, something he carried into his interviews and media duties.\nBut this isn’t the end for Tsunoda in Formula 1. We saw what happened when Alex Albon was dropped for the 2021 season – as the Thai driver earned a seat in Williams for the following year thanks to his relentless dedication in the simulator. Bottas also showed how a year as a reserve can reinvigorate a driver, as well as giving plenty of opportunity to complete side quests on social media. With some hard work and a bit of luck, Tsunoda could be back on the grid sooner than you think."}

His departure will leave a void, and we will truly miss him.\n\"I would like to express my sincere gratitude for his unwavering support, not only over the past months, but also during my early days at Scuderia Toro Rosso.\n\"On a personal note, Helmut, along with [CEO] Oliver Mintzlaff, was the driving force behind bringing me back into the Red Bull family, first in Faenza and then this summer in my current role in Milton Keynes.\n\"Helmut is a real racer at heart, always pushing us to the limit, always prepared to take risks in pursuit of our goals.\"\n\"I have been involved in motorsport for six decades now, and the past 20-plus years at Red Bull have been an extraordinary and extremely successful journey,” said Marko himself. “It has been a wonderful time that I have been able to help shape and share with so many talented people. Everything we have built and achieved together fills me with pride.\n“Narrowly missing out on the World Championship this season has moved me deeply and made it clear to me that now is the right moment for me personally to end this very long, intense, and successful chapter.\n“I wish the entire team continued success and am convinced that they will be fighting for both world championship titles again next year.“\nOliver Mintzlaff, Red Bull’s CEO of Corporate Projects and Investments, added that: “Helmut approached me with the wish to end his role as motorsport advisor at the end of the year. I deeply regret his decision, as he has been an influential figure for more than two decades, and his departure marks the end of an extraordinary era.\n“Over more than 20 years, Helmut has earned incomparable merits for our team and the entire Red Bull motorsport family. He played a decisive role in all key strategic decisions that made Red Bull Racing what it is today: a multiple world champion, an engine of innovation, and a cornerstone of international motorsport.\n“His instinct for exceptional talent not only shaped our junior program but also left a lasting impact on Formula 1 as a whole. Names like Sebastian Vettel and Max Verstappen stand for the many drivers who were discovered, supported, and guided to the very top under his leadership. His passion, his courage to make clear decisions, and his ability to spot potential will remain unforgettable.\n“After a long and intensive conversation, I knew I had to respect his wishes, as I gained the impression that the timing felt right for him to take this step. Even though his departure will leave a significant gap, our respect for his decision and our gratitude for everything he has done for Red Bull Racing outweigh it.\n“Helmut Marko will be deeply missed, both personally and professionally. We wish him all the very best for the future and hope that he will remain closely and warmly connected to the team.”\nF1 Correspondent Lawrence Barretto says...\nRed Bull have been prolific in backing young racing talent and supporting them on their journey to Formula 1 – and Marko should take a lot of credit for that.\nHe was the one who pushed Red Bull's founder Dietrich Mateschitz to give Verstappen his F1 debut in 2015 – ensuring that it was the energy drinks firm who got the Dutchman's signature rather than Mercedes.\nHe was the one in constant contact with junior formula teams trying to sniff out the next big thing.\nHe was the one who would sit down with the aspiring driver face-to-face, one-to-one and decide there and then whether or not they had what it took to deliver race wins in Formula 1 for the Red Bull family.\nThe impact has been impressive and long-lasting. Seven of the 20 drivers on this year's grid have come through the Red Bull Junior Programme – Verstappen, Alex Albon, Carlos Sainz, Isack Hadjar, Liam Lawson, Yuki Tsunoda and Pierre Gasly.\nBut nothing lasts forever – and Marko's departure is just the latest step in Red Bull's evolution."}

Well, we’ve got you covered. In an all-in-one explainer, we take you through the basics from how the championship was formed to the circuits visited, the drivers behind the wheel and the teams involved up and down the pit lane…\nWhat is Formula 1?\nAs the highest class of international racing for single-seater formula racing cars, Formula 1 is the pinnacle of motorsport and the world’s most prestigious motor racing competition. There really is nothing like it.\nIt’s a team sport (it needs to be to change all four tyres on a car in under two seconds!), though the drivers are more like fighter pilots than sportspeople. Battling extreme g-forces, making daring decisions in the blink of an eye – and at more than 370kph (230mph). To be the best, F1 drivers push themselves – and their incredibly innovative machines – to the very limit.\nDrivers compete for the F1 Drivers’ Championship , while the teams fight for the F1 Teams’ Championship and prize money based on their position at the end of the season.\nEach race is known as a Grand Prix, and they’re held in incredible locations around the world. The 2026 Formula 1 calendar features 24 Grand Prix weekends, which include six F1 Sprint races, taking place from March through December.\nHow many drivers and teams race in F1?\nA total of 11 teams and 22 drivers from around the world make up the current Formula 1 grid, with each squad fielding two cars.\nDriver experience ranges from multiple World Champions like Lewis Hamilton , Max Verstappen and Fernando Alonso – as well as the new 2025 World Champion Lando Norris – to rookie racer Arvid Lindblad who is embarking on his first F1 campaign in 2026 with the Racing Bulls team.\nWhen it comes to teams, there are those who have been in Formula 1 since the early years, such as Ferrari (competing continuously since the very first season in 1950) and McLaren , and relative newcomers like Haas who entered the sport ahead of the 2016 season. In 2026 there is also a brand-new team to support with Cadillac entering for the first time.\nWhere does F1 race?\nA total of 24 races in 21 countries across five continents are included on the Formula 1 calendar . Classic circuits such as Silverstone , Spa-Francorchamps and Suzuka , combined with more recent additions including Las Vegas , Miami and Saudi Arabia , give an exciting and varied selection of tracks.\nMonaco , Monza , Silverstone and Spa are circuits that still feature on the schedule from the very first F1 season in 1950, although plenty of safety-based changes and track layout modifications have been made since then.\nThere is also a brand new track in 2026 for F1's drivers to tackle as Madrid hosts the Spanish Grand Prix on the new, purpose-built Madring circuit.\nFormula 1’s inaugural season in 1950 featured seven rounds, spread out from May to September, predominantly staged in Europe – the exception being the Indianapolis 500 in the United States, which most F1 drivers sat out.\nNew European events arrived as F1 developed, with the following decades also bringing adventures to South America, North America, Africa, Asia, Australia and, most recently, the Middle East – well and truly putting the ‘world’ in World Championship.\nHow does the F1 weekend work?\nThe standard Formula 1 weekend sees each event take place over three days – typically Friday, Saturday and Sunday (Las Vegas is an exception running from Thursday, Friday and Saturday).\nFriday traditionally features two 60-minute Free Practice sessions (FP1 and FP2) for teams to set up and optimise their cars. These are typically used to make sure the car works as it should, before set-up changes are then made and race preparations continue.\nOn Saturday, after a final practice session (FP3), drivers head into a three-stage session called Qualifying. The slowest six drivers from the 18-minute Q1 phase are eliminated from the session, before six more go out after the 15-minute Q2 segment. That sets positions 20-11 on the grid for the Grand Prix prior to any penalties. The final 12-minute-long Q3 then decides the top 10 grid slots, including the coveted pole position for the fastest driver.\nSunday brings the Grand Prix itself, where drivers battle it out to score points, grab a spot on the podium and reach the chequered flag first to win the race.\nHow long do F1 races last?\nFormula 1 races generally last between an hour-and-a-half to two hours, though this can be impacted by Safety Car periods that slow the field down or red flags that halt the action – see the 2023 Australian Grand Prix as a prime example.\nEach race on the calendar has a set number of laps based on the length of their circuit. The distance of every race is almost always equal to the fewest number of laps that exceed 305 kilometres (189.5 miles).\nMonaco is an exception to the rule, where the race length is equal to the fewest number of laps needed to exceed a distance of 260 kilometres (161.5 miles), given the lower speeds of its street circuit nature.\nWhat’s the F1 Sprint?\nThe F1 Sprint is a short race. It covers 100km – about one-third of a typical Grand Prix distance – and should last about 30 minutes. This length has been chosen to encourage a race that is dynamic rather than strategic, with no mandatory pit stop.\nWhile the bulk of the Formula 1 season consists of traditional Grand Prix weekends as we’ve covered above, six of them – a quarter of the 24 events in total – have been designated F1 Sprint events, which add another layer of excitement to proceedings.\nA Sprint weekend is still a three-day affair with the Grand Prix as the main event, but the Sprint Qualifying session (which sets the grid for the Sprint) replaces FP2 on Friday afternoon. The Sprint itself takes place on Saturday (instead of FP3), before Qualifying for the Grand Prix happens as normal.\nThe venues chosen for Sprint events are all tracks with great overtaking potential, picked to try and ensure the Sprint is a flat-out, aggressive melee from start to finish. Points are on offer, from eight down to one, awarded to the first eight cars to finish.\nSix venues are hosting F1 Sprint events in 2026 as the exciting roster sees China and Miami on the Sprint line-up for a third consecutive year. Silverstone returns to the Sprint Calendar for the first time since the format's inaugural event in 2021, while Montreal , Zandvoort and Singapore are set to host their first ever Sprint weekend.\nHow can I watch F1?\nFormula 1 is watched by huge numbers of fans around the world. This includes the hundreds of thousands who flock through the gates at each Grand Prix weekend to catch the action in-person and the millions more who follow it from afar.\nIf you’re planning on going to a Grand Prix yourself, a wide range of packages to suit different needs and budgets are available via the official F1 Tickets , F1 Hospitality and F1 Experiences portals.\nOur F1 TV Pro subscriptions give you access to live coverage of every session at every Grand Prix weekend (in selected territories), along with a comprehensive back catalogue of historic races, documentaries and shows.\nFans can also enjoy Formula 1 in cinematic form by watching F1 The Movie , which stars Brad Pitt as veteran racer Sonny Hayes – more on which below.\nWhy is it called Formula 1?\nThe reason why Formula 1 is called Formula 1 is two-fold.\nFirst up, the ‘Formula’ is a set of rules – covering car design, engine size, component usage and much, much more – that all competitors must abide by. Secondly, the ‘1’ simply denotes that it is the premier formula.\nHow do F1 cars work?\nThousands of parts are involved in creating some of the fastest and most advanced racing cars on the planet – spanning detailed bodywork, suspension elements, turbo-hybrid power units, eight-speed paddle shift gearboxes, 18-inch tyres and much, much more.\nWhen the engine powers it forward, an F1 car essentially acts as an aeroplane flipped upside down, with front and rear wings – and everything in between – pushing the car down onto the track and giving it incredible levels of grip through corners.\nThat said, for 2026 F1's technical regulations have been completely revamped in the biggest shake up the sport has seen for more than a decade. The previous 'ground effect' aerodynamic concept (that lasted from 2022-2025) has completely changed, with cars now shorter, narrower, lighter and nimbler.\nThe previous era's cars had several carefully designed tunnels underneath the car's floor, sucking the car to the track surface, but in 2026 the cars will have flatter floors instead.\nHowever, the most significant change regarding the aerodynamics is the introduction of Active Aero – the cars can adjust the angle of both their front and rear wing elements depending on where they are on track. In the corners the flaps stay shut, to maintain grip, and on the designated straights, the drivers can activate low-drag mode, which opens the flaps and flattens the wings to reduce drag and boost their top speed.\nBut that's not all that's changing, as the power units are also getting a significant revamp. While the core is still a 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrid, the power balance has shifted significantly – for 2026 we've got roughly a 50-50 power split between petrol and electric.\nThis makes the power units more road relevant – and more attractive to existing manufacturers Ferrari and Mercedes, newcomers Red Bull Powertrains in partnership with Ford, General Motors (from 2029) and Audi, plus returning suppliers Honda.\nWhat are F1 cars powered by?\nF1 cars are powered by V6 turbo hybrid engines, which together with various other systems create the ‘power unit’. A V6 engine is an internal combustion engine with six cylinders arranged in two banks of three, forming a 'V' shape – hence the name.\nAs mentioned above, F1 will be featuring new-for-2026 power units with a roughly 50-50 power split between petrol and electric. To power the new hybrid unit, the car's Energy Recovery System (ERS) can now recharge the battery onboard with twice as much energy per lap – compared to previous power units – through things like recovery under braking or lifting off the throttle at the end of straights.\nFor the first time ever F1 power units will also be running Advanced Sustainable Fuels, which have been trialled in Formula 2 and Formula 3 in 2025. The fuel is made from cutting-edge sources like carbon capture, municipal waste and non-food biomass – and it is independently certified to meet strict sustainability standards.\nWhere are F1 teams based?\nMost Formula 1 team factories can be found in the United Kingdom, with seven operations calling England their primary home, though Haas have facilities in Italy (thanks to a component supply arrangement with Ferrari) and the United States (where their other motorsport activities are based).\nAs for the other four teams, Audi are located in Switzerland (with bases also in Germany and the UK), while Ferrari and Racing Bulls both operate out of Italy. The Cadillac team, making their F1 debut in 2026, are headquartered in the US – specifically in Fishers, a suburb of Indianapolis – but they also have a UK base next to Silverstone.\nWhat’s the difference between F1 and the FIA?\nF1, more specifically Formula One Management (FOM), is owned by United States-based media company Liberty Media and hold the sport’s commercial rights.\nThe FIA, founded in 1904, is the governing body for a host of motorsport competitions around the world, including Formula 1. They oversee the technical, sporting and financial regulations, ensuring that competitors are sticking to the rules, and set stringent safety standards.\nF1 works closely with the FIA to put on a show each year – hence the official name: ‘FIA Formula One World Championship’.\nWhen did Formula 1 start?\nFormula 1 was formed as a World Championship competition back in 1950, with the first-ever race held at the Silverstone Circuit – a former Royal Air Force station – in the United Kingdom on May 13 of that year.\nSix more events were staged in a season which saw Alfa Romeo driver Giuseppe ‘Nino’ Farina become the sport’s first World Champion – edging out team mates Juan Manuel Fangio and Luigi Fagioli.\nWhile motorsport had been taking place since the late-1800s, with Grand Prix events growing in popularity across the following decades, 1950 marked the start of the official F1 championship that remains to this day.\nWho are the most successful F1 drivers of all time?\nFrom F1’s all-time list of World Champions, Lewis Hamilton shares the overall record of seven Drivers’ titles with Michael Schumacher . Hamilton claimed his first title with McLaren in 2008, before adding six more at Mercedes between 2014 and 2020, while Schumacher won the 1994 and 1995 crowns with Benetton, adding another five (in a row) at Ferrari from 2000 to 2004.\nAs it stands, Hamilton also holds the record for the most race victories, logging 105 ahead of the 2026 season, along with the most pole positions too, having taken 104.\nFellow multiple champions include Juan Manuel Fangio , who racked up five titles in the 1950s, Alain Prost , who won four across the 1980s and 1990s, Sebastian Vettel , who collected a quartet of championships on the bounce from 2010 to 2013, and Max Verstappen , who took his fourth consecutive crown in 2024.\nAyrton Senna was a driver who looked poised to reach even higher numbers in his legendary F1 career, but a tragic accident at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix left him with a tally of three, alongside several other famous names.\nFernando Alonso , who won back-to-back in 2005 and 2006, is another title-winning driver on the current grid in 2026, while F1's newest champion Lando Norris claimed his maiden Drivers' title in 2025 – meaning we have four World Champions amongst our current cohort of drivers.\nWho are the most successful F1 teams of all time?\nWhile the F1 Drivers’ World Championship was in place from the inaugural 1950 season, the Teams’ equivalent did not arrive until 1958, when Vanwall triumphed over Ferrari .\nSince then, Ferrari have established themselves as the most successful team in terms of championship wins, collecting 16 Teams’ titles over the decades. McLaren are next on the list with 10 crowns, the  most recent of which came last year in 2025, while Williams are on nine. They are followed by Mercedes on eight and Red Bull on six.\nAs for Drivers’ titles, Ferrari lead the way on 15, with McLaren their nearest challengers on 13, ahead of Mercedes (nine), Red Bull (eight) and Williams (seven).\nFerrari have also racked up the most race victories, having claimed 248 ahead of the 2026 season, followed by McLaren (203), Mercedes (131), Red Bull (130) and Williams (114).\nWhat is F1 The Movie ?\nF1 The Movie is the Apple Original Films motion picture released internationally on June 25 and on June 27 2025 in North America, bringing the sport to the big screen like never before.\nThe film tells the story of former F1 driver Sonny Hayes (played by Brad Pitt ), who makes a comeback to partner rookie team mate Joshua Pearce ( Damson Idris ) at the fictional APXGP team.\nDirected by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Pitt, Jerry Bruckheimer and Lewis Hamilton , the movie was filmed during real-life Grand Prix weekends, with Pitt hailing the drivers and teams as being a “big part” of the film .\nThe drivers went on to enjoy a private screening of F1 The Movie in Monaco and gave a positive reaction to how the sport was depicted on the big screen.\nPitt and Idris also got behind the wheel themselves when shooting the film’s racing sequences after both undergoing training to drive the cars.\nF1 The Movie – which also stars Kerry Condon and Javier Bardem – held its star-studded New York premiere on June 16, followed by the European premiere in London on June 23.\nThe movie is now available to stream now streaming on Apple TV+ ."}

A driver swap, a Team Principal departure and performances that saw them prop up the Teams’ Championship underlines how challenging the year has been. With the Enstone-based squad’s focus switching to 2026 long ago, in a bid to capitalise on the new regulations that come into play, it has been a case of getting to the end of 2025 as quickly as possible. Here’s their end of year report…\nBest finish\nPierre Gasly – 6th in Great Britain\nWith Alpine’s efforts firmly focused on 2026 and the new regulations, the team’s results in 2025 do not make for the greatest reading – particularly after the summer break. Pierre Gasly’s efforts in Brazil deserve a mention, with the Frenchman picking up a point in both the Sprint and the race, but that was the Enstone-squad’s only score in the second half of the season.\nAs a result, the British Grand Prix remains Alpine’s best finish in 2025 as Gasly capitalized on the dramatic mixed conditions to take a very impressive sixth. Having hauled his car into the top 10 in Saturday’s Qualifying, the 29-year-old maintained his place despite the challenging weather.\nWith the right calls at the right time, he would go on to pick off the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll on the final lap of the Grand Prix to earn eight very well-deserved points.\nQualifying head-to-head\nGasly 5-1 Doohan Gasly 13-5 Colapinto\nFor the opening six rounds of 2025, Jack Doohan was alongside Gasly – but the more experienced Frenchman came out on top in the Qualifying head-to-heads. Miami was the only exception as the Australian made it to Q2 in what would turn out to be his final weekend in the Alpine seat.\nWith Franco Colapinto installed in place of Doohan from Imola onwards, it was Gasly who still comfortably had the better of his younger team mate with the Argentine’s best Qualifying performance his P12 in Canada.\nIn comparison Gasly made Q3 10 times across 2025, a real achievement in a car generally considered the weakest on this season’s grid.\nRace head-to-head\nGasly 4*-1 Doohan Gasly 11-7 Colapinto\nGasly again leads the way in the race head-to-head against both team mates, though his match up with Colapinto is closer than in their Qualifying scores.\nThe Frenchman was, however, responsible for scoring all 22 of Alpine’s points – 20 of those coming before the August break and two coming afterwards (both in Brazil) – which meant Alpine were the highest-scoring last placed team in F1 history, a feat they achieved at Silverstone as Gasly’s P6 saw them overtake the previous record holders Haas who had 12 in 2023.\nIf they take nothing else from 2025 they can at least take that.\n* Gasly was disqualified from the Chinese Grand Prix for an underweight car\nBest moment\nIn a year that was low on highlights, that sixth-placed Silverstone result for Gasly reappears once again in this section. Credit should also be given for his P7 in Bahrain and his points in Brazil, when Alpine had firmly turned the taps off in favour of looking ahead to next year.\nAnd, if we’re going to seek out another positive, the Frenchman was adamant that the team had become “way more united” in a challenging campaign. They’ll certainly be hoping to have more contenders for this category going forwards anyway.\nWorst moment\nThere’s a few… Gasly’s disqualification in China, finishing P19 and P20 in Abu Dhabi and more change within the Alpine hierarchy all spring to mind.\nBut for this, we’re going to crown their Azerbaijan Grand Prix weekend as the worst moment of 2025. With Gasly entering the run-off in a chaotic Q1 – a Qualifying session that would prove to be an epic – Colapinto would go on to hit the wall heavily at the same corner just a few seconds later, bringing out the red flags again.\nBoth cars were out of Q1 in bitterly disappointing fashion, with one facing a significant rebuild job, and race day hardly went any better as the pair finished last of the runners in P18 and P19 (McLaren’s Oscar Piastri had crashed out on the opening lap).\nGoals for 2026\nAlpine have long been focused on 2026, when sweeping new regulations come into play, in a bid to haul themselves back up the Teams’ Standings. Quite simply, being last next year is not an option.\nWhile there have been more changes at the top – Team Principal Oli Oakes left his role within a year of joining and long-time Renault CEO Luca de Meo left in June – there have been moves to give the team stability. Step one is sticking with their driver line-up, both Gasly and Colapinto are signed on, while Steve Nielsen joined as the team’s Managing Director, reporting to Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore.\nNext season also sees the squad swapping to customer Mercedes power, rather than producing their own power units, a decision that Briatore hopes brings success.\n\"We are setting the team for next season,” he told F1.com earlier this year . “We will have a great Mercedes engine and gearbox. I'm sure next season will be good for the team and we give our drivers the right car to compete. We are doing the best possible and my target is to be in P6 [next year].\"\nTime will tell as to whether that target will be realised when the form book is ripped up next year."}

The hope? That comes in the form of 2026 as new regulations bring new possibilities, and we can see what magic Adrian Newey has come up with. Here is Aston Martin’s 2025 end of year report…\nBest finish\nFernando Alonso – 5th in Hungary\nFernando Alonso began the 2025 season in difficult form as the Spaniard had to wait until Round 9 at his home event to record his first top-10 finish of the year.\nWith upgrades delivered during that European triple header helping Aston Martin progress, Alonso went on to grab points at every weekend up until the summer break – bar a difficult outing for the team in Belgium – with that run culminating in a best finish of fifth in Hungary.\nAlonso continued to deliver impressive performances after the August break, with points-scoring finishes coming in Zandvoort, Singapore, Austin, Qatar and Abu Dhabi – a sixth place in the finale also helped lift him into the top 10 of the Drivers’ Championship.\nTeam mate Lance Stroll began 2025 strongly, his sixth-place in the season-opening Australian Grand Prix proving his best result as he notched up 33 points for 16th in the standings.\nQualifying head-to-head\nAlonso 24-0 Stroll\nAlonso outqualified Stroll at every Grand Prix weekend this year as the Canadian struggled over one lap – he only managed to get out of Q1 nine times in 24 attempts across 2025.\nYou have to go back to the 2024 British Grand Prix for the last time Stroll bested his team mate in Qualifying, showing that Alonso’s one-lap pace hasn’t deserted him as he prepares to enter his 23rd Formula 1 season next year.\nRace head-to-head\nAlonso 16-8 Stroll\nThe two-time World Champion holds the upper hand in the Grand Prix head-to-head too after overcoming his aforementioned difficult start to the season, going on to break into the top 10 of the Drivers’ Standings.\nBy the time the August break arrived both drivers were on 26 points apiece, but Alonso went on to collect a further 30 points in the final 10 rounds of the year compared to Stroll’s seven in the same time period (six of which came courtesy of his seventh place finish in Zandvoort).\nBest moment\nGiven the challenging Belgian Grand Prix the team endured – with both Alonso and Stroll finishing a lowly 17th and 14th respectively – the turnaround that came in Hungary a week later was spectacular.\nWith Alonso missing first practice in Budapest due to a muscular injury in his back, and reserve Felipe Drugovich taking his place, the Spaniard bounced back with a fifth in FP2 before going on to qualify in the same position on Saturday. As mentioned above, he went on to convert that into a fifth-placed finish on race day for the team’s best result of the year, as Stroll added to the points tally with his own impressive result of seventh that day.\nWorst moment\nAston Martin have had their challenges in 2025, including a run of point-less races between Japan and Monaco (barring Stroll’s Miami Sprint result) and only being able to run one driver in Spain after the Canadian was forced to withdraw to undergo a medical procedure .\nThe team’s result in Belgium was also difficult, but for the worst moment of 2025 we’re going to opt for their Sunday in Monza. Stroll would go on to finish 18th that day – the last of the runners – while Alonso had shown promise after qualifying ninth and lining up in eighth on the grid thanks to Lewis Hamilton’s penalty.\nHowever, any hope for points were dashed when – as he was running seventh – he was forced to retire with a suspension failure. The cause? A piece of gravel was kicked up by Lando Norris’ car at the start and struck the front right push rod on Alonso’s car. When your luck’s out and all that…\nGoals for 2026\nLike many on the grid, Aston Martin have been focused on 2026 for some time in the hope that they can capitalize on the sweeping new set of regulations and fight at the front.\nNot only do they have consistency with their driver line-up, with both Alonso and Stroll continuing next year, but they also embark on their new era with Honda acting as the team’s exclusive power unit supplier – the Japanese company had previously had a long-standing partnership with Red Bull.\nThere’s also the Adrian Newey factor to consider. The design guru began working with the Silverstone outfit at the start of 2025, having spent the best part of two decades with Red Bull, and his primary focus in his position as Managing Technical Partner has been leading the design team with 2026 in mind. Soon we will see the fruits of that labour.\nHowever, there is a question mark over Aston Martin’s leadership as it was announced ahead of the Qatar Grand Prix that Newey would be taking on the Team Principal role for 2026 – the first time he’s ever assumed that position.\nIn doing so he takes over from Andy Cowell, who had taken on the role himself from Mike Krack in January 2025. Instead, Cowell will become Chief Strategy Officer in order to focus on Aston Martin’s partnership with Honda.\nBut will those added responsibilities distract Newey from car design? The Briton insists not, as he said he was “determined not to dilute” his focus in that area.\nTime will tell as to whether Aston Martin have got all this right. But given the money invested in the operation, fighting further forward is a must in 2026."}

With the team’s focus switching to 2026 earlier than expected, here’s Ferrari’s end of year report…\nBest finish\nCharles Leclerc – 2nd in Monaco and Mexico City\nAs touched on above, Ferrari were just 14 points behind winners McLaren in the 2024 Teams’ Championship. The hopes were high that the momentum would continue into 2025, particularly with the all-star driver line-up of Hamilton and Charles Leclerc .\nHowever, Ferrari went without a Grand Prix win across the entire season. While Hamilton did record victory in the China Sprint , Leclerc would take the team’s best Grand Prix results of the season with second in both Monaco and Mexico. Overall, there were seven podiums for Leclerc in 2025, but the Monegasque will have hoped for much more at the start of the year.\nIn contrast Hamilton has yet to record a podium finish for Ferrari – but he came agonisingly close with fourth in Imola, Austria, Silverstone and Austin.\nQualifying head-to-head\nLeclerc 19-5 Hamilton\nQualifying has been a struggle for Hamilton in 2025 as he continues to get used to life at Ferrari after so many successful years at Mercedes . The end of the season was particularly painful as his Q1 exit in Abu Dhabi was the third consecutive time he exited at the first hurdle – and the fourth if you include Sprint Qualifying from Qatar.\nLeclerc had some starring moments in Qualifying this season as he comfortably led the head-to-head score, the most notable being his shock pole in Hungary – a result that left him as baffled as everyone else. “Today I don’t understand anything at Formula 1!” he said immediately afterwards.\nHe would also claim seven further top-three Qualifying results (third in Bahrain, Belgium, Austin and Sao Paulo and second in Monaco, Austria and Mexico) but, by his lofty standards, he has also found it tough to tame the SF-25 at various times.\nRace head-to-head\nLeclerc 18-3 Hamilton*\nLeclerc also comes out on top in the race head-to-head with his seven-time World Champion team mate, ultimately finishing the season with 242 points to Hamilton’s 156 points (the pair were fifth and sixth respectively in the final Drivers’ Championship standings).\nOf course, it is fair to mention that 2025 was the Monegasque’s seventh season at the Scuderia, while Hamilton has been getting used to his new surroundings all year.\nAdditionally, while Leclerc did notch up seven podiums, Hamilton had several strong recovery drives to bounce back from his Qualifying hiccups. Twelfth to fourth in Imola, and 19th to eighth in Las Vegas are two examples of the places he was able to make up on race day. Should the Briton iron out those struggles over one lap then stronger results are likely to follow.\n* No scores are awarded for the Chinese GP as both drivers were disqualified, and the Dutch GP and the Sao Paulo GP as both drivers retired.\nBest moment\nDespite a challenging season, Hamilton did produce what we’re crowning as Ferrari’s best moment from 2025 – when everything clicked in Shanghai as he won the Sprint in just the second round of the season, having also secured Sprint pole on the Friday.\nNo doubt the seven-time World Champion will be chasing many more moments like that in the team’s famous red.\nWorst moment\nWhile double DNFs in Zandvoort and Sao Paulo come close, we’re still branding what happened the day after that Sprint win as Ferrari’s worst moment from 2025.\nWhile the Briton and Leclerc had lost ground in the Grand Prix to finish sixth and fifth respectively, those points were soon taken away in their entirety with the duo both disqualified. Hamilton was excluded after post-race checks found his car had exceeded plank wear limits, while Leclerc’s car was found to be underweight.\nWhat could have been a morale-boosting weekend ended painfully and rather set the tone for the rest of the year.\nGoals for 2026\nFerrari ended 2025 fourth in the teams’ standings, down two places on their 2024 finish. But the biggest gauge as to how far the Scuderia dropped off was their gap to McLaren – 14 points in 2024, which ballooned to 435 in 2025.\nAs with every team up and down the grid, the new regulations for 2026 offers the chance for a reset, and team boss Fred Vasseur made the decisive decision to switch focus early on this year as it became apparent they would not be challenging McLaren at the sharp end.\n“McLaren was so dominating in the first four or five events that we realised it would be very difficult for 2025,” Vasseur said . “It meant that we decided very early in the season – I think it was the end of April – to switch to '26.\n“It was a tough call. Perhaps I also underestimated a little bit the call on the psychological side, because when you still have 20 races to go, or 18 races to go, and you know that you won’t bring any aero development, it's quite tough to manage psychologically.”\nWhile that goes some way to explaining Ferrari’s year, that decision will only have paid off if they start 2026 well and are closer to the front than they have been.\nAnd there’s also the Hamilton factor to consider, with the Briton still getting used to life at Maranello to a certain extent. Providing a driver that holds a joint-record seven titles with the tools to flourish is another must – and Ferrari will be able to fully reap the benefits of that all-star driver line-up they have."}

Here is the team’s end of year report…\nBest finish\nOllie Bearman – 4th in Mexico\nDuring the first half of the campaign, Esteban Ocon recorded Haas ’ then-best finish of P5 in China, a result that they were unable match in the races that followed as the squad struggled for consistency.\nHowever, that points tally was boosted more frequently post-summer break – particularly by Bearman , who equalled the team’s best-ever result in their history when he crossed the line in fourth at the Mexico City Grand Prix.\nBearman labelled his P4 as a “feel-good moment” , having climbed from P9 on the grid and gone wheel-to-wheel with none other than Max Verstappen along the way.\nQualifying head-to-head\nBearman 14-10 Ocon\nWhen we assessed the head-to-head Qualifying statistics for Haas at the midway point of the season , Ocon was leading Bearman on 8-6.\nIt is Bearman, however, who ends the year on top, outqualifying his team mate on 14 occasions, which included a career-best P8 in both Austin and Sao Paulo.\nRace head-to-head\nBearman 12-12 Ocon\nAs was the case in Qualifying trim, Ocon had the edge over Bearman in the race day numbers following the first half of the season – but the pair end 2025 on equal footing, each having finished ahead of the other 12 times. Bearman recorded three DNFs in comparison to just one for Ocon.\nIn terms of points scored, Bearman just beats his team mate by a tally of three, having collected 41 points – putting him in P13 of the Drivers’ Championship – while Ocon scored 38 in P15.\nBest moment\nThere have been several double points finishes for Haas in 2025, starting with a much-needed score in China, a result that marked quite a turnaround from a challenging race one week earlier in Australia.\nBut, as touched on above, the most special was arguably in Mexico, with Bearman sealing that impressive fourth place – matching the team’s previous best finish by Romain Grosjean back in 2018 – while Ocon added to the haul by taking two extra points in ninth.\nIt was a fitting achievement for Bearman in what proved to be an impressive second half of the season for the 20-year-old, with Team Principal Ayao Komatsu saying of the result : “Ollie drove fantastic and gave us completely the right information, the strategy guys did an amazing job – race engineer, performance engineer, everyone gave the right information to the driver communicating, so it was just a huge team effort, and finally, we managed to get a big result.”\nWorst moment\nHaas had hoped to remain in the fight for P7 of the Teams’ Championship until the end – but their chances of challenging Aston Martin for the position took a dent during a particularly difficult weekend in Qatar.\nWhile Bearman initially looked to be in the fight for points, the Briton received a 10-second stop/go penalty due to his car being released from a pit stop in an unsafe condition, before he later retired from the race. Ocon also took a penalty for a false start – and then received a second penalty for failing to serve the first correctly, the Frenchman eventually crossing the line down in P15.\nLooking back further, other tough moments for Haas included their tricky start to the campaign in Australia – where they found themselves way off the pace – and an intra-team collision between Bearman and Ocon at Silverstone, with both finishing outside of the points .\nGoals for 2026\nDespite the team missing out on that seventh place, Haas actually scored more points in 2025 than in the previous campaign, and Komatsu spoke of his pride following the season finale in Abu Dhabi at how the outfit had managed to make progress for a second consecutive year.\n“This year the competition is so much tighter, and in the last seven races, we scored in six of them,” he explained . “It’s amazing that we’ve improved the cars two years in a row and finished the season on a high, it gives us confidence going into next year.”\nIndeed, that upward trajectory will surely provide a solid platform for Haas entering into 2026. There is also an increased sense of stability this time around as Bearman and Ocon go into their second campaign with the team – another factor that the squad will be hoping to benefit from amid the uncertainty posed by new technical regulations.\nLike Komatsu, both drivers spoke of the strong foundations that they believe are in place for Haas to build on next season. Bearman in particular will likely take heart from his promising run in the latter half of 2025; if he can iron out the occasional mistakes that crept in, the British driver could be one to watch in 2026."}

That pattern was reversed this season as he was frequently knocked out of Qualifying early on before going on to surge through the pack, doing so in Australia, Spain and Britain, among others.\nNevertheless, once he had found his feet in his first season after winning the 2024 Formula 2 title, Bortoleto began to shine in Qualifying, beating Hulkenberg’s best showing of 10th in Brazil with P7 in both Hungary and Abu Dhabi to prove that the team made the perfect choice when crafting their line-up for the next few years.\n* no score for Sao Paulo GP Qualifying as Bortoleto did not take part following a heavy crash in the Sprint\nRace head-to-head\nHulkenberg 12-11 Bortoleto\nAs their head-to-head statistics show, the Sauber pair were pretty evenly matched this season, with Wheatley explaining at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix that he has “been tremendously proud of the drivers for what they’ve achieved this year and the relationship they have, which is helping to drive the team forward”.\nAside from Hulkenberg’s fairytale podium, Bortoleto tended to exceed expectations in the races, with five points finishes and a stunning sixth place at the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he proved just how much he had improved over the season.\nHulkenberg just pips the Brazilian in the head-to-head, with Bortoleto’s occasional incidents and strategic missteps not helping him out. The older driver’s side of the garage wasn’t without error either – he was disqualified from the Bahrain GP due to excessive skid block wear, and a collision with Pierre Gasly in Qatar caused one of his two DNFs.\n* no score for the Bahrain GP as Hulkenberg was disqualified\nBest moment\nBefore Hulkenberg’s arrival, Sauber hadn’t claimed a podium since Kamui Kobayashi took third place at the 2012 Japanese Grand Prix, so the German’s P3 at Silverstone undoubtedly has to go down as their best moment of the season. Not only did it end the team’s patient wait for a return to the rostrum, but it also marked Hulkenberg’s greatest result in his 15-year career.\nHe received hundreds of messages congratulating him on the emotional achievement, and the result contributed significantly to their total points tally of 70. Speaking before the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, where they took another two points, Wheatley said: “It is strange to have 68 points and be in P9 – if we look historically, that would have been P6 or P7 in the championship.\n“I think it just shows that in the hybrid era, what we’ve achieved this year to get that amount of points is extraordinary.”\nWorst moment\nBortoleto carried the brunt of the low points this season, notably enduring a dire weekend at his home event in Brazil. It started in the Sprint, where he suffered a massive 57g impact while battling with Williams’ Alex Albon and was thankfully uninjured.\nEager to bounce back, Sauber worked on his car relentlessly but were unable to repair it ahead of Qualifying, leaving the 21-year-old to start the Grand Prix from last place on the grid. He recovered well at lights out, gaining positions before Lance Stroll tapped his car to send him slamming into the barriers for the second time. It was an agonising end to the round, made all the worse by the fact it took place on home soil.\nGoals for 2026\nAfter demonstrating remarkable progress this season, the Sauber name will be no more as Audi prepare to complete their full takeover in 2026. With their greatest points total since 2012, they must carry this momentum forward and focus on stabilising their position as a consistent midfield team.\nBortoleto will no longer have the excuse of being a rookie to back up any future collisions, and the team will be hoping that they can rely on both drivers to fight for points in every round and drag them higher up the standings, as their original ambition to finish fifth in the Constructors’ gradually fell away from them in the latter part of 2025.\nThey have everything in place to succeed next season – a driven, refreshing Team Principal, two brilliant drivers who continue to push each other, and a new identity with Audi keen to hit the ground running in the next era of F1 ."}

Team mate Oscar Piastri, meanwhile, had to settle for third following a close intra-team battle through the campaign. Here is the title-winning squad’s end of year report…\nBest finish\nLando Norris – 1st in Australia, Monaco, Austria, Britain, Hungary, Mexico and Brazil; Oscar Piastri – 1st in China, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Miami, Spain, Belgium and Netherlands\nMcLaren were easily the most winningest team in 2025, with Norris and Piastri each chalking up seven Grand Prix victories apiece.\nThe papaya outfit were particularly dominant during the first half of the season, having seen one of their drivers stand on the top step of the podium at 11 out of 14 races prior to F1’s summer break.\nWhile they stood equal on wins, it was Norris who ultimately beat Piastri to the Drivers’ Championship , with the Briton enjoying a strong run of form during the second half while Piastri faced a more challenging sequence.\nQualifying head-to-head\nNorris 13-11 Piastri\nIn terms of Qualifying trim, Piastri had the edge over Norris across the opening portion of the campaign. The Australian achieved his first career pole position at Round 2 in China, and had outqualified Norris by eight to six as of Round 14.\nHowever, Norris took the momentum later in the year, racking up three consecutive poles between Mexico City and Las Vegas en route to beating his team mate in the head-to-head scores.\nRace head-to-head\nNorris 13-10 Piastri\nNorris also ends 2025 on top of the race day statistics against Piastri, reaching the finish line ahead of the other McLaren on 13 occasions throughout the season.\nPiastri is only just behind on 10 better results, with Las Vegas not counted here due to both cars being disqualified after the rearmost skid wear was found to be below the minimum thickness required in the technical regulations.\nBest moment\nWhere to start in a season that brought so many highlights for McLaren? The first part of the campaign delivered numerous positive moments – with Norris and Piastri responsible for the majority of race wins – but the greatest accolades came in the second half.\nBecoming Teams’ Champions for a second consecutive season was a landmark moment for an outfit that spent so many years trying to climb back up to the top and recapture their glory days. To wrap this up so early in the campaign – in Singapore, still with six rounds to spare – made it all the more remarkable.\nNeedless to say, that achievement was made even sweeter when Norris clinched his maiden World Championship at the finale in Abu Dhabi, marking the first time that McLaren had taken home both titles since back in 1998.\nWorst moment\nWhile the above showcase the greatness experienced by McLaren in 2025, their campaign was not without its difficulties; indeed, there is more than one candidate for their worst moment, the first being Norris and Piastri’s collision in Canada that put the former – who took the blame for the incident – out of the race.\nThere were two more particularly tough weekends for the team in store across the season-closing triple header. At a time when all points were crucial amid the resurgence of rival Max Verstappen , it was a huge blow when both cars were disqualified from the Las Vegas Grand Prix.\nA good result was needed one week later in Qatar to keep the threat of the Red Bull man at bay – but a strategy misfire from McLaren saw Piastri miss out on a potential victory, with the Australian having to settle for second while Norris crossed the line in fourth.\nGoals for 2026\nFor starters, McLaren will be hoping to carry the success they experienced this year forwards into 2026; should they win a third Teams’ Championship in a row, it would mark their strongest run since taking four back-to-back titles between 1988 and 1991.\nThe squad’s so-called ‘papaya rules’ – focused on giving both drivers equal opportunity to win – is an aspect that will not change, according to CEO Zak Brown . The approach has occasionally faced criticism at the times when it backfired, with Brown acknowledging that the team will take “learnings” from these moments – and ironing out such errors will perhaps form one of their key targets entering into the new campaign.\nThough there may have been occasions where the ‘papaya rules’ did not work out, Norris and Piastri appear to have maintained a relatively harmonious relationship . While it was Norris who triumphed in the title fight, Piastri has set out his expectation that this will not alter their dynamics going forward.\n“For me, he’s obviously had a great season this year and a deserving champion, but he’s still Lando Norris,” Piastri explained post-race in Abu Dhabi. “It’s not like he’s become Superman. So, I don’t think things will change with that.\n“I’m expecting full fairness from the team and equality going forward. I don’t have any concerns that that will change at all. Clearly, Lando’s had a very strong season this year, and ultimately did a better job.”\nNorris himself has previously stated that he does not believe in momentum, but it will be fascinating to see if achieving his long-awaited dream of becoming World Champion gives him an edge into the start of 2026 – a season that brings the additional challenge of navigating new technical regulations – or if Piastri can repeat his impressive form from the first half of 2025 to once again take the fight to his team mate."}

However, with 2025 marking the start of their post-Lewis Hamilton era, there is much to be positive about ahead of the arrival of 2026’s new regulations. Here is Mercedes’ end of year report…\nBest finish\nGeorge Russell – 1st in Canada and Singapore\nWith Hamilton departing over the off-season, courtesy of his blockbuster move to Ferrari, George Russell assumed the position of senior driver at Mercedes . He has taken to the role like a duck to water.\nNot only has the Briton found a new level of consistency, but he added two impressive Grand Prix victories of his own in Canada and in Singapore. In the words of his boss Toto Wolff, he has been “formidable” in 2025.\nWith seven more podiums scored on top of those wins, Russell was deservedly best of the rest behind this season’s title-fighting trio of Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri and Max Verstappen, ultimately finishing in fourth place with 319 points.\nQualifying head-to-head\nRussell 21-3 Antonelli\nAs is perhaps not surprising, Russell’s experience told as he had the better of rookie team mate Kimi Antonelli in Qualifying – the former having completed his seventh season in Formula 1 compared to the young Italian’s first.\nTwo pole positions came the way of Russell in Canada and Singapore – both races he would go on to win – while he described his effort around Montreal as “one of the most exhilarating laps of my life.”\nMuch has been said of Antonelli’s mid-season slump over the European leg of the campaign, but the Italian still caught they eye at times with his one-lap pace. Look no further than his Sprint pole in Miami as he became F1’s youngest-ever polesitter in any format.\nRace head-to-head\nRussell 21-3 Antonelli\nThe Mercedes duo’s race head-to-head matches the Qualifying numbers – again the more experienced Russell comes out on top, which is hardly surprising given his nine podium finishes.\nAs mentioned, Antonelli’s form dropped over the European leg of the season after a promising start, but also picked up in the latter portion of the campaign. Three podiums (in Canada, Sao Paulo and Las Vegas) is far from a poor return for the teenager, and his highest finish of second in Brazil came with a charging Verstappen breathing down his neck.\nBest moment\nWhile Singapore was a great day for the Silver Arrows – as Russell won with Antonelli coming home in fifth – Canada was undoubtedly the highlight for Mercedes this year.\nNot only did Russell secure victory – a win the Briton said he felt had made up for the “victory lost” in 2024 – but Antonelli scored his first podium with third at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve.\nWorst moment\nMonaco was a nightmare weekend for Mercedes. Both drivers suffered early Qualifying exits as Antonelli crashed out in the final minutes of Q1 and Russell’s car lost power in Q2. If ever there’s a Qualifying session you don’t want to be out of early, then it’s Monaco.\nAs Antonelli and Russell lined up in 15th and 14th respectively on the grid, Sunday would prove to be an utterly frustrating affair as they were stuck in traffic. So exasperated was Russell at being unable to pass the Williams of Alex Albon that he cut the Nouvelle Chicane to overtake, a decision he received a drive-through penalty for.\nIn the end Russell would cross the line in 11th while Antonelli was 18th. But at least Russell got a dinner out of it courtesy of Albon .\nGoals for 2026\nNew rules, new opportunity – Mercedes will look to 2026 as the perfect chance to rediscover the dominance they enjoyed before the ground effect era arrived in 2022. After a relatively barren run of success since then, challenging for titles again is undoubtedly the goal in 2026.\nRussell certainly sounded positive for what was to come after the team confirmed both he and Antonelli would be continuing as the Silver Arrows' drivers for the 2026 season. “I’m loyal to Mercedes, they’ve shown their loyalty in me, and I believe, going into 2026, Mercedes without a doubt is my best chance of winning a World Championship,” he said ahead of the United States Grand Prix.\n“Maybe we’re wrong. Who knows? No one knows what will happen in 2026. But if I could have every single seat available to me, I would still choose Mercedes.”\nAs with any good storyline, the side plots might also be just as interesting as what happens on track. Look no further than this year’s Verstappen to Mercedes speculation, for example, which started to mount after Wolff said he had been having conversations with Verstappen about a drive for the Silver Arrows.\nWhile Verstappen confirmed ahead of the summer break that he would be staying with Red Bull for 2026, and Mercedes went on to confirm Russell and Antonelli , if the Brackley-based squad hit the ground running next season that would make the Silver Arrows an enticing prospect for any driver seeking out success…"}

When their two young drivers found their rhythm, they delivered some exceptional performances, but their inexperience showed at times with errors this season. Here is the squad’s end of year report…\nBest finish\nIsack Hadjar – 3rd in the Netherlands\nFresh off the back of a tense battle for the Formula 2 title with Kick Sauber’s Gabriel Bortoleto , Hadjar's season began in the worst possible way when he crashed out on the formation lap at the season opener in Australia. But there were already flashes of his potential, particularly in Qualifying.\nHe gradually progressed up the order with some strong results before enduring a run of five rounds with just one point, and bouncing back at the Dutch Grand Prix in spectacular fashion. There, he qualified an impressive P4 and benefitted from Lando Norris’ unfortunate retirement to gain a spot and claim his maiden podium and an important 15 points.\nHis confident performance that day demonstrated that he didn’t just have raw speed, but could also manage a race well and resist pressure, which influenced Red Bull’s decision to promote him to partner Max Verstappen next season.\nQualifying head-to-head\nHadjar 1-1 Tsunoda Hadjar 16-6 Liam Lawson\nFor the first two rounds of the season, Yuki Tsunoda raced alongside Hadjar at Racing Bulls , but the call came for him to swap with Lawson and move to Red Bull. While they were relatively close across the season, Hadjar undoubtedly had the edge over his second team mate, outperforming him in Qualifying on 16 occasions.\nHis best start was the fourth place that kickstarted his drive to the podium at Zandvoort, and he followed that up with another top-five start at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix. On one of the six weekends when Lawson outqualified the Frenchman, he did it in style, taking advantage of a chaotic session in Azerbaijan to secure P3 on the grid behind Verstappen and Williams’ Carlos Sainz.\nRace head-to-head\nHadjar 1-1 Tsunoda Hadjar 13-8 Lawson *\nTheir race head-to-head paints a similar picture with Hadjar edging out the Kiwi at 13 events to eight, which is also reflected in their points total – the rookie ended the season on 51, narrowly missing out on a spot in the top 10, with Lawson accumulating 38.\nLawson did break into the top 10 in Monaco, where Racing Bulls achieved a double points finish, but his best result of the year came at Baku where he took the chequered flag in fifth place.\n* No score is awarded for the British Grand Prix as both drivers retired\nBest moment\nStanding on the podium in your rookie season is a remarkable feat no matter what, but the fact that Hadjar’s P3 at Zandvoort was the team’s first since Pierre Gasly in 2021, when they competed under the moniker of AlphaTauri, made it all the more momentous.\nHe was one of nine drivers to make it to the rostrum in the Grand Prix format, joining fellow midfield drivers Nico Hulkenberg and Carlos Sainz, both of whom achieved their first podiums with Kick Sauber and Williams respectively.\n“It feels a bit unreal,” said Hadjar at the time. “What was most surprising for me was keeping that fourth place for the whole race.\n“Unfortunately for Lando, we took advantage of his [retirement], but we made no mistakes. The car was on rails the whole weekend, and I'm really happy about myself because I really maximised what I had, made no mistakes and brought home the podium, so I'm so happy for my guys.”\nWorst moment\nRacing Bulls suffered what can only be described as a nightmare weekend at Silverstone, with both drivers embroiled in incidents that forced them to retire, marking one of nine weekends where the team failed to score any points.\nWet weather races are renowned for the opportunities they present to squads further down the grid as the conditions can cancel out many competitive advantages – Hulkenberg proved this as he claimed his maiden podium at the same event, ending a 238-race streak without finishing in the top three.\nLawson wasn’t quite as lucky, crashing out on the opening lap after a collision with Haas driver Esteban Ocon. Conversely, Hadjar made it through the first stint, part of which was conducted behind the Safety Car, before he ploughed into the rear of Kimi Antonelli’s Mercedes as racing resumed.\nThe double retirement saw them drop behind Kick Sauber in the Standings and draw level on points with Aston Martin. Although they overtook both teams by the end of the season, Silverstone was without a doubt a missed opportunity for Hadjar and Lawson.\nGoals for 2026\nThere will be even more change at Racing Bulls in 2026, with Hadjar moving to Red Bull while Arvid Lindblad joins as the season’s sole rookie. Under the guidance of highly accomplished Team Principal Alan Permane, who replaced Laurent Mekies in a summer reshuffle, they will prioritise keeping the positive trajectory that they discovered this season.\nLawson was outperformed by his young team mate and will now have to fully embrace his role as the senior driver while Lindblad gets to grips with the new environment. If the Kiwi can take every opportunity that presents itself and decrease his tendency to clash with other drivers, regular points finishes could be on the table for him.\n\"Having a driver who will be able to also help Arvid is good,\" Permane recently told F1.com . \"It's something I've spoken to Liam about. I don't expect him to be a mentor for Arvid, far from it, but I do expect him to be there.\n\"OK he has only got a season and a half under his belt, but he has a lot more than Arvid has. He should be able to – and I would expect him to – help Arvid out when things are tough for him, especially early on and during testing.\"\nThe new regulations and complex design of the cars could also see the competitive order shift, but after their flashes of success this season, Racing Bulls should be aiming to rise above tough opposition from teams like Williams to top the midfield. To do so, they will need to nail both the strategy and execution while continuing to nurture the talents of their two young drivers."}

Max Verstappen went from seemingly being out of title contention to only narrowly losing out on a fifth World Championship, racking up more wins than his rivals along the way. But there were struggles for Yuki Tsunoda, leading to another driver change for 2026. Here is Red Bull’s end of year report for 2025…\nBest finish\nMax Verstappen – 1st in Japan, Emilia-Romagna, Italy, Azerbaijan, United States, Las Vegas, Qatar and Abu Dhabi\nPrior to F1’s summer break, Verstappen ’s win tally this season stood at two, the Dutchman having struggled to add to that number amid a dip in performance for Red Bull .\nThat picture changed quite dramatically during the second act as the squad bounced back; out of 10 races, Verstappen stood on the top step at six, bringing him right back into the Drivers’ Championship fight against the McLarens.\nAs well as earning those victories through his own champion-level driving, the 28-year-old ensured that he was ready to capitalise on any mistakes by his rivals – as was the case when Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris lost out on a potential win in Qatar owing to a strategy misfire from the papaya squad .\nQualifying head-to-head\nVerstappen 2-0 Lawson Verstappen 22-0 Tsunoda\nVerstappen was completely dominant in Qualifying form against both of the drivers who lined up alongside him in 2025, with Liam Lawson demoted back down to Racing Bulls after a tricky opening two rounds while his replacement Tsunoda also failed in trying to match the four-time World Champion.\nThis run of strong Saturdays for Verstappen saw him claim eight pole positions, bringing his career total up to 48.\nRace head-to-head\nVerstappen 2-0 Lawson Verstappen 21-1 Tsunoda\nUnsurprisingly, it is also advantage Verstappen in the race day head-to-heads. Tsunoda’s only finish ahead came at the Austrian Grand Prix, where Verstappen recorded his sole DNF of the season following a Lap 1 collision with Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli.\nThe final standings make difficult reading for Tsunoda; while Verstappen ended the Drivers’ Championship in second place on 421 points, the Japanese racer wound up down in 17th on a tally of 33.\nBest moment\nIt is remarkable that after that performance lull for Red Bull earlier in the season – which led Verstappen to effectively rule himself out of the championship – the Dutchman not only returned to regular winning ways during the second half but only narrowly missed out on the title by two points.\nAs such, there are various highlights to choose from Verstappen’s eight Grand Prix wins, but perhaps one of the greatest moments of the season was actually not one of his victories and is instead his recovery drive from a pit lane start in Brazil .\nWhile he did not claim P1 at the event – in the vein of his 17th-to-win masterclass in the 2024 race – the four-time World Champion had even more ground to recover this year, particularly when his initial rise through the pack was brought to a halt by a puncture.\nThat setback did not stop him, and Verstappen was chasing Antonelli down in a battle for P2 towards the latter stages. He ultimately crossed the line in third, a result that the Red Bull man hailed as “incredible” , adding: “I didn’t expect that at all.”\nWorst moment\nThe aforementioned struggles of the squad’s home race in Austria certainly proved to be a moment to forget for Red Bull. Qualifying had proven far from smooth, with Tsunoda eliminated in Q1 while Verstappen took P7 after being hindered by a late yellow flag.\nOn race day things went from bad to worse; Verstappen was tagged by Antonelli on the opening lap and found himself immediately out of the running, and Tsunoda crossed the line in 16th and last place.\nUnfortunately the difficulties faced by the 25-year-old throughout the season perhaps account for another of Red Bull’s toughest aspects of the campaign, with Verstappen’s points haul alone not enough to lift the squad higher than third in the Teams’ Championship .\nGoals for 2026\nIt seems likely that the first goal for Red Bull will be to start 2026 in the manner that they ended 2025; had that level of performance been there earlier in the campaign, the championship fight could arguably have been even closer than it was.\nDespite the sport’s introduction of new technical regulations posing some uncertainty, there is perhaps a greater level of stability for the squad entering into next year, with Team Principal Laurent Mekies now firmly entrenched in his role after replacing Christian Horner in July.\nVerstappen insisted that missing out on the 2025 title by two points was not a disappointment , given that he was at one stage more than 100 points adrift of the lead. But the Dutch racer remains in the form of his life and will undoubtedly be keen to be in the fight again in 2026, a season he has labelled as “a big question mark for everyone”.\nOne less question, however, centres around the identity of Verstappen’s team mate, with Isack Hadjar confirmed to make the step up from Racing Bulls . Mekies has set out his expectations for the youngster, stating: “We see it as another start for him to continue to develop, to continue to impress us, to continue to surprise us.”\nOnly time will tell if Hadjar can build on his promising rookie season and deliver on those targets, and whether Red Bull can ultimately return to the top spot in 2026."}

Can they build on that further in 2026?

Amongst these was a particularly tough weekend in Austria, in which neither car made the finish as Sainz was unable to start due to a car issue.\nWhile Sainz finished in the points more frequently towards the end of the championship, it was not enough for him to outscore Albon in the race day statistics. Albon also just fended off Sainz for P8 in the Drivers’ Championship , taking nine points more than the latter.\nBest moment\nSainz’s maiden podium as a Williams driver at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix was undoubtedly a special moment, made all the sweeter by the struggles that he and the team had faced at times during 2025.\nPrior to arriving at the Baku City Circuit, Sainz had failed to score a point on Sunday across the previous six rounds. The 31-year-old more than made up for that at Round 17, setting the second-fastest time during Qualifying before sealing P3 in the race.\nA delighted Sainz struggled to sum up his emotions after a tricky start to his first campaign with Williams, commenting on the result: “Honestly, I cannot describe how happy I am or how good this feels. It tastes even better than the first-ever podium that I did. We’ve been fighting hard all year and, finally today, we just proved that when we have the speed.”\nAnother highlight came when Sainz collected a second rostrum in Qatar , a finish that proved especially significant in confirming fifth place in the Teams’ Championship for Williams, their strongest position since 2017.\nWorst moment\nThere were a few difficult moments for the team through 2025, including a double disqualification from Qualifying in Singapore due to technical breaches on both cars, while Sainz and Albon each endured frustrating runs outside of the points at various stages of the season.\nMore recently, though, a low point came during a strangely absent performance from Williams at the Abu Dhabi finale. Only one week on from the high of Qatar, the team did not look in contention for points at the Yas Marina Circuit and ultimately finished in 13th and 16th places.\nDespite ending what had been a promising year on a low note, Sainz suggested that the weekend should act as a reminder that the squad cannot rest on their laurels.\n“I hope it serves as a good wake-up call to the team, that after a podium you come back in Abu Dhabi thinking you are going to be strong and we were quite weak this weekend,” he explained . “I’m actually happy this happened, so we go into the winter without falling asleep.”\nGoals for 2026\nEarlier in the season, Team Principal James Vowles stated that holding onto P5 in the Teams’ Championship would “mean the world” to Williams – and when the result was confirmed with one round to spare in Qatar, the Briton acknowledged that it “surpasses our expectations” .\n“I hope it shows the world the direction we are on and the belief we have in where we are going as a result of things,” Vowles added, with the outcome marking just one step in Williams’ ambition to return to the front of the grid.\nThe Grove-based outfit were amongst those to switch their focus to 2026 at an early stage in the season, a decision that they will be hoping pays off as they look to build further on what has been a very positive campaign. However, as Sainz warned in Abu Dhabi, the squad need to ensure that they do not become complacent over the winter.\nAfter some years of transition – following the arrival of Vowles in 2023 and Sainz this year – Williams have stability going forwards, with both drivers onboard for the long-term. The energy within the team certainly seems optimistic, with Vowles recently saying : “It's the start of our journey and I can't wait for what's next.”"}

That was an unbelievable race, edge of your seat stuff,\" said Brown.\n\"Charles was in our DRS, close call with Yuki. Oscar drove brilliantly, Max is a machine, so to beat Max and an awesome team like Red Bull is such an accomplishment. Racing with Lando and Oscar, you couldn't ask for a better driver line-up.\n\"The pit stops and then having to cover Leclerc, there's just so many things that can go wrong and everything went right. It's a long season.\"\nWhile McLaren comfortably secured the Teams' Championship with several races remaining, the Drivers' title went down to the final race after a late surge by Verstappen and Red Bull.\nThis year also marked back-to-back Constructors' titles for McLaren, but the crown for Norris is the first Drivers' title for the team since Lewis Hamilton back in 2008.\n\"You're always asked what's more important and I can tell you the stress and desire to win the Drivers' Championship was every bit as high [as the Constructors'],\" said Brown.\n\"So rewarding, so happy for the team and both our drivers. I'm looking forward to coming back and racing next year.\"\nWhile Verstappen and Piastri completed just one pit stop in the 58-lap race, Norris pitted twice with the first stop bringing him out in traffic.\nHaving made his way back through the field and into P3, the McLaren driver made a second stop to cover off Leclerc behind.\nTeam Principal Andrea Stella admitted it was difficult to know which was the correct strategy, having also put Norris and Piastri on different starting tyres to try and cover off Verstappen.\n\"The chat at the pit wall was that we just have to cover Leclerc and we kind of go to our defensive, responsive strategy,\" he said.\n\"With Oscar, we tried to go as long as possible [on the hard], see if we could catch a Safety Car and then see at the end with the medium tyres if we could go and catch Verstappen, but Verstappen was once again too fast and he deserved the victory.\""}

", "published_time": "2025-12-17T13:00:18.243Z", "url": "https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-f1-rules-for-2026.48bv0VTxhIlhrQXmxercXk", "content": "Formula 1 prides itself on being at the forefront of innovation – and the relentless pursuit of breaking new ground continues next year when the championship’s rules will be revamped in the biggest shake up the sport has seen for more than a decade.\nFrom 2026, Formula 1 will feature a revised aerodynamic package that will deliver new-look cars alongside an overhauled set of power unit rules that are engaging for existing manufacturers Ferrari and Mercedes, attractive to newcomers Red Bull Powertrains – who have teamed up with Ford – Audi and General Motors (the latter launching their power unit in 2029) and attractive enough to bring Honda back to the party…\nOooooh, interesting. Okay, you’ve succeeded in getting my attention. How big are we talking?\nWell, let’s kick off with the aero rules. For starters, the cars will be shorter, narrower, lighter and nimbler. The wheelbase has been shortened, which in theory means they should be more responsive through corners. The cars will still be fitted with 18-inch Pirelli tyres – but they are narrower. That’ll cut drag – and trim off yet more weight. Oh – and those little arches above the front tyres are no more, which keeps the cars cleaner and yes, you guessed it, lighter again.\nI’m liking the sound of this. Keep the good stuff coming…\nNo problem! There was a lot of focus on the intricate floors underneath the car in the last era of regulations that lasted from 2022-2025. But from 2026, it’s all change. It’s goodbye long ground-effect tunnels and hello flatter floors with extended diffusers with bigger openings. This will mean less downforce and a higher ride height requirement that should lead to a greater variety of set-ups that suit a greater range of driving styles – thus levelling the playing field.\nGood, good. And what’s this I hear about different wings?\nIt seems you’re well informed! From next year, both front and rear wings will be simpler, which roughly translates to fewer elements. The rear beam wings will be no more, while at the other end of the car, the front wing will feature narrower elements. The outer sections of the front wing will also offer potential new areas of development and this will certainly be a critical battleground for teams, as the front wing heavily influences the car’s overall aero performance.\nLovely stuff. But…\nHang on, I haven’t finished with the wing chat yet! The most significant change is the introduction of Active Aero. The cars can adjust the angle of both their front and rear wing elements depending on where they are on track.\nIn the corners, the flaps stay shut in their default position to maintain grip. On designated straights, drivers can activate low-drag mode, which opens the flaps and flattens the wings, reducing drag and boosting top speed. This is available to every driver, on every lap.\nSo does that mean it’s the end for DRS?\nYes, Active Aero means essentially saying goodbye to DRS in its current form, as the rear wing flaps can be opened on every designated straight without the need to be within one second of the car in front. However, being inside one second of your rival does still bring benefits in the form of Overtake Mode.\nOooooh. Overtake Mode. That sounds fun!\nYep, especially because a driver can strategically use it. The mode is just for attack and is triggered when they’re within one second of the car in front. That gives them access to extra electrical energy which they can use to deploy to overtake or pressure the driver ahead at a single detection point.\nNice. Do they still have a button to activate maximum power from the engine and battery?\nThey sure do. This has been renamed the Boost button and drivers can continue to use it in defence as well as overtaking at any point around the lap, providing they have enough charge in their battery, of course. Drivers may use it all at once or spread across the lap, depending on when they have the best chance to attack or where they are most vulnerable.\nGreat – so that’s two helpful tools at the drivers’ disposal. Anything else?\nYes, there is. Drivers will oversee their battery recharge. Working with their race engineer, the duo can select from a range of different modes to recharge their battery, from braking and engine energy. That means they have three tools they can use tactically when in the heat of battle.\nLet’s get stuck into the power unit changes, then. What’s happening under the hood?\nA lot. While the core is still a 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrid, the power balance has shifted significantly. From 2026, the internal combustion engine output has been cut while the electric motor has tripled, meaning we’ve got roughly a 50-50 power split between petrol and electric. This makes the power units more road relevant – and thus more attractive to existing manufacturers Ferrari and Mercedes, newcomers Red Bull Power Trains in partnership with Ford, General Motors (from 2029) and Audi, plus returning suppliers Honda.\nThat sounds like a fun challenge for the power unit engineers…\nYou’re not wrong – but this is the kind of challenge they love. To power the new hybrid unit, the car’s Energy Recovery System (ERS) can now recharge the battery with twice as much energy per lap, through things like recovery under braking or lifting off the throttle at the end of straights. The revamp of the power unit does mean it’s the end of the expensive and complex MGU-H (a heat recovery system), which lacked road relevance and added weight.\nAnd what fuel will these new power units be running on?\nI’m glad you asked. For the first time ever, Formula 1 power units will be running Advanced Sustainable Fuels, which have been trialled in F2 and F3 in 2025. The fuel is made from cutting-edge sources like carbon capture, municipal waste and non-food biomass – and it is independently certified to meet strict sustainability standards.\nThat’s pretty cool. There’s a lot there already – but anything else?\nNo rule change would be complete without further enhancements to safety – and 2026 is no different. The drivers’ survival cell will be subjected to more rigorous tests, while the roll hoop will be strengthened to take 23% more load – that’s roughly the weight of nine family cars. The front impact structure design has been tweaked so it now separates in two stages to give drivers greater protection in big crashes where there are secondary impacts after the initial contact.\nOut of interest, who shaped these rules?\nThat would be governing body the FIA in close collaboration with the teams and commercial rights holder Formula 1. The result was a ruleset that has already attracted four manufacturers – which means more competition and more innovation.\nSuperb. Do you mind summing it all up for me in a nutshell, please?\nDon’t mind if I do. Formula 1 cars will continue to be fast, to be cool, to be awe-inspiring to watch. But from 2026, they will be more challenging for the teams and the drivers. They’ll have to deal with new tech and tighter rules – while managing a greater set of tools to attack or defend that can make or break their ultimate performance and finishing position.\nWith less downforce and tighter control over turbulent air, following a car through a corner should be easier – while getting the best out of the car should be a greater challenger for the drivers. This is the future of Formula 1, powered by advanced sustainable fuel and smarter energy use. Bring. It. On."}

As well as the euphoria and relief felt by the McLaren driver, his family and his friends trackside, a quiet corner of Somerset, England – where Norris went to school – beamed with its own pride over the completion of a special journey…\nNorris’ trophy-filled school days\nBorn in Bristol to British father Adam and Belgian mother Cisca on November 13, 1999, Norris spent his education at the nearby Millfield Prep School and Millfield School, where he carefully balanced studies with a developing karting career that took him across the UK and Europe through the 2000s and 2010s.\n“Almost straight away he was coming back with trophies,” Dan Close , who taught Norris at the time and is now Millfield Prep School’s Deputy Head of Operations, tells F1.com. “He was quite shy to begin with, and he didn’t really want his trophies presented in assembly – maybe because they were taller than he was, thinking about these great big things in motor racing!\n“Interestingly, one of Lando’s Year 3 teachers wrote in one of his reports that if he didn’t want to be presented for anything and wanted to remain anonymous, maybe he had a position as the ‘Stig’ [on British motoring television show Top Gear]. That was when he was eight years old.\n“Apart from that, he just got stuck into everything. He played some rugby, some hockey, some cricket, and he got involved in all the bits and pieces that go with school life.\n“His family were very good as well, working with us in terms of him being away from school, and making sure he got all the work that he needed to catch up on, because obviously it’s never a done deal that you’re going to rise to the heights that he’s risen to.\n“His mum would often stay in Somerset while Lando and his dad were off doing their thing, and that’s not easy, so I love the way that he was really thankful [after winning the title]. It’s refreshing that it was also about other people, rather than all about himself, because he recognises that this is not something you can do alone.”\nStaying true to his core values\nIndeed, what Close and his Millfield colleagues have taken plenty of satisfaction from is Norris never appearing to let the success – and fame that came with it – go to his head while he impressively worked his way through the motorsport ranks.\nNorris went from karting World Champion in 2014 (a year before he left Millfield) to full-time McLaren F1 racer in 2019, via wins and titles in a host of single-seater championships, but Close sees the same person at the end of it all.\n“I suppose what we’re most proud of as a school is that Lando’s remained authentic,” he adds. “It’s one of our school values, to be authentic. He said he wanted to win the title his way , and we feel he has done that.\n“He doesn’t seem to have changed a bit, and again, I think a lot of that comes from his mum and dad. All four of their children have been through the school – his older brother and the two girls – and they’ve always kept them very grounded.\n“The man we see on the F1 podium today has still got that sort of glint in his eye – and the cheeky smile – he had when he first joined us at school.\n“He’s just a good lad who never got arrogant about what he was doing. He always seemed to hide his light under a bushel, if anything, and didn’t seek the limelight in that regard, but it’s all paid off in the end.\n“He’s managed to live his dream, and that’s how he came in at Millfield. His Year 3 teacher said, ‘When you’re World Champion, I hope you remember who taught you!’, and I’m sure that he’s kept those values. We’re just enormously proud of him.”\nAppreciating the highs and the lows\nDue to the timing of the season finale and the latest school term ending, Millfield’s community could not celebrate together when Norris crossed the line in Abu Dhabi and sealed the deal, but Close expects a suitable ceremony to be held in the New Year.\nNot only will that landmark title be recognised, but also the trials and tribulations experienced along the way, as touched on by Close above and as spoken about by Norris at length in the past – from mental health struggles to the challenges that come with delivering under extreme pressure.\n“As a community, we haven’t really had a chance to reflect and celebrate, but I guarantee you that when we come back from the Christmas holiday, the first assembly of the year will centre on Lando and his achievements,” says Close.\n“We’ll talk about how he’s had to be resilient and bounce back through the highs and lows, through the things that have gone right and the things that have gone wrong, along with the dedication and the perseverance, because it doesn’t come without effort.\n“I think that’s the message that we’ll pass on to the children. We’ve got a fine tradition at Millfield of producing some worldclass sporting people, as well as in other areas, but the one thing we often talk to the children about is coping with failure, understanding that you’re going to learn from that, and that it’s not the end of the world.\n“If you’re true to yourself, if you push on and you believe enough, that will help you part of the way, and then with a bit of talent and a few bits of luck, who knows?”\nAs for what else can be expected, Close adds with a smile: “I’m sure our catering department will have a ‘Lando lunch’ as well, where they all wear orange or papaya, and maybe we’ll serve the children with papaya fruit, because obviously that’s the McLaren colour.\n“And, just reflecting on it, the main pathway from our reception and dining block to the main school block is called the ‘M5’, because that’s where all the traffic is, and that’s the big road in the southwest – but maybe we should change it to ‘Lando Way’ or something.\n“Clarks Village, which is the local shopping outlet, actually added a ‘Lando Lane’, so they’ve stolen a march on that one! But we’ve got a big banner with Lando’s name on it and everything he’s achieved, and we’re going to have to change the banner to ‘2025 World Champion’, which is pretty exciting.”\nInspiring the next generations\nWith the dust settling on Norris’ success, Close is already looking forward to watching his former student write the next chapter in his life and career, while continuing to inspire the next generations that pass through Millfield’s doors.\n“The children in the school just love to see one of ours having some success,” Close comments, admitting they would go “absolutely nuts” if Norris manages to pop back for a visit. “We had Rory Gibbs, a gold medallist at the Paris Olympics in rowing, return to the school last year, as well as James Guy, who was an Olympic champion swimmer.\n“They see these people come through the school and they know that it is possible [to reach those heights], because only a few years ago, Lando was sitting on the floor in assembly in the same spot that they are now. I think that’s the most inspiring thing.\n“Ultimately, as an establishment, we are so proud of Lando and his family for everything they've managed to achieve, and we wish him every future success. It’s going to be amazing to see the number one on his car next year. When you know somebody and you’ve had some investment in their life, you just want them to do well.\n“I, for one, will be voting for him for BBC Sports Personality of the Year, and we’ll be encouraging everybody else in the school to do the same. That’s the next thing. It’s strong competition, but that would be the cherry on the top…”"}

Those impressive displays earned him a full-time opportunity for 2025 and, at the end of a whirlwind rookie season, he has only enhanced his reputation as one of the sport’s brightest young talents. Shortly before it drew to a close, the 20-year-old Briton sat down with F1.com to relive the journey…\nThursday afternoon’s media duties ahead of the Mexico City Grand Prix weekend are in full swing, with Bearman jumping between broadcast and written interviews for outlets from all over the world before joining us in the sun outside Haas’ hospitality unit.\nBearman finds his F1 feet\nRace suit tied around his waist, a wide smile on his face, and carrying a relaxed demeanour, Bearman looks completely at ease with life in the paddock – as if he is a veteran of the sport, rather than a newcomer who has little more than 20 Grands Prix under his belt.\nAfter going through the trials and tribulations often experienced by F1 rookies earlier in the season, Bearman has hit a strong run of form, starting with a superb sixth-place finish at the Dutch Grand Prix and backed up by P9 results in Singapore and Austin.\n“I’m really happy with how it’s been going, especially the second half of the season,” Bearman tells F1.com as we begin to review the year – and his proper step up to the top echelon. “It’s been a lot more controlled and less of a blur than before. Those three races I did last year were quite crazy, but I’ve managed to find my feet in F1.\n“It was still a bit overwhelming [at the start] to have so many commitments and things to do during a race weekend, because you’re so busy compared to what I’ve been used to in F2, but that’s something I’ve been able to handle better as time goes on.\n“Of course, I’m very aware of how lucky I am to be here, and I’m enjoying every single moment. Stepping up to F1 is a dream that I’ve been trying to achieve for my entire life. I’ve bonded with the team and we’ve worked well together so far.”\nAs it transpired, Bearman hit another peak in his burgeoning F1 career at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, where he made the most of Haas’ recently upgraded car in the tricky high-altitude conditions to secure a spot in Q3, then launched it into the top six places on the first lap and ultimately came away with P4.\nIt was a gutsy, elbows out drive – you only have to ask four-time World Champion Max Verstappen about their exchange through the esses – that reminded onlookers of his exploits in Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan in 2024, and reinforced why Ferrari have been backing him as one of their junior drivers for so many years.\n“It’s a feel-good moment,” Bearman smiled to me in the media pen after that race, holding back tears as his mother, father and partner watched on. “To go side-by-side with Max is a very cool feeling; he’s someone I have basically grown up watching in F1, so it’s awesome. I’m really proud of the job we did.”\nLessons on and off the track\nBearman’s points-scoring charge would extend to Sao Paulo (where he finished sixth) and Las Vegas (10th), making it the longest run of all the rookies on the F1 grid in 2025, while banishing the memories of some painful moments from the first half of the year.\nAlongside a pair of crashes at the season opener in Australia and a few tricky Qualifying sessions, there were red flag violations during practice in Monaco and Great Britain that triggered costly 10-place grid drops on both occasions – the latter “silly” incident sending him from a fine eighth on the grid to 18th, and leaving him outside the points on race day.\n“There have been some mistakes that I wasn’t proud of or happy with,” he says, before pointing out: “I’m also allowing myself space for these errors, because I’m aware of my position. I’m a rookie, I’m still learning, and I’m building up. These mistakes are going to happen.\n“I feel like everything so far has been a great opportunity to learn and improve. That’s really the most important thing. It doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a continuation and a big learning process. That’s what I’ve been doing well this year.”\nIn addition to those on-track situations, Bearman has learnt a huge amount about life as an F1 driver off the track, particularly when it comes to working effectively with his engineers and mechanics, and making the most of any car developments.\nBearman’s efforts at the Melbourne opener were not helped by instability problems that Haas initially experienced with their VF-25, which left team boss Ayao Komatsu “feeling sick” , and required fast-tracked car changes for the third round in Japan.\nDriver feedback was crucial at this point and, while Ocon had several years of F1 experience with various teams to draw upon, Bearman found himself in new territory – the youngster working hard to fill in some of the gaps in his knowledge and get to grips with the situation.\n“It’s not only [moments] that have been visible on track, but also ones I’ve had behind the scenes, like how I work with the team and the way to approach things,” Bearman says of his growth, which was proven by how well he exploited a Haas upgrade package across that late-season points-scoring run.\n“Whenever we bring new upgrades on the car, I’m trying to figure out how to get the most out of them, and understand what I want from the car as well. There have been occasions where I feel like some things have been left behind, or things that I haven’t considered because I lack knowledge, and that’s just part of the process.\n“It’s something that I’ve improved on a lot, but it’s also never [the case] that you arrive somewhere and you’re happy with it. It’s a continuation of the process. I’ve been happy with my progress, and the team seem to be happy as well, which is the important thing.”\nImpressing the boss\nIndeed, Komatsu – described by Bearman as a “great leader” who put Haas on a “great trajectory” when he took over as Team Principal in early 2024 – had challenged his new driver to make the next step shortly before the season’s final flyaway phase.\n“I think the speed, there’s absolutely no question [about it],” Komatsu said. “You see it, there’s no doubt the talent is there. For us, it’s really a matter of harnessing that talent and then delivering it consistently: every session, every race weekend.\n“We’re working with Ollie very, very closely, providing short-term objectives, getting feedback, [talking about] work ethic, etc. But he’s a great kid – he’s got such a great personality, a positive personality that motivates everyone, and then he’s very, very open-minded.\n“He also takes constructive feedback – even the criticism – very, very well, so we have a very good working relationship, and it’s our target this year, [in the] races remaining, just to really showcase his talent consistently. That consistency is the key.”\nWhat Bearman showcased between Singapore and Las Vegas ticked all of those boxes and, while Qatar brought the misfortune of a race-ending pit stop issue and Abu Dhabi a painful Q2 exit by the finest of margins, there are plenty of positives to take into the winter.\nBearman’s excitement for 2026\nThat winter period, of course, will involve Haas applying the final touches to their challenger for 2026’s regulations reset – one that offers opportunities for teams up and down the grid, but also comes with another wave of lessons and nuances to be learned.\nPut to him that he will be dealing with two all-new cars in as many F1 seasons, Bearman replies with another smile: “The other drivers have had more years than me in this [type of] car, so maybe it’s good to reset things a little bit!\n“Generally, I feel like this car has suited me quite well, but I’m excited to see how next year’s car drives. I haven’t driven it on the simulator yet, so it’s definitely going to be interesting – also to see the challenges that it throws up at us.\n“All of the lessons learnt across the previous two eras of car are being put into practice on the new one. We’ve been bringing upgrades and bringing performance recently, which shows that the aerodynamics team is working very well.”\nHe adds: “Of course, I want the fastest car possible, and I want to score points for the team, but my own performance is irrespective of what the car is doing. I’ve set solid foundations this year, I’ve seen a really good improvement, and I want to continue to build on that next year.\n“I’m going to have a bit more interaction with the team over the winter break. I have a clearer idea of what I want, even so far as the steering wheel is changing, and I want to have a close eye on how that looks. Whereas last year, it wasn’t my job to do that, as I didn’t know anything.\n“It’s definitely a difference to last year, and I’m excited to see how that will look in the winter. It’s a short break, so I’m trying to recover my energy as much as possible, and we’ll see what happens next year. It’s a challenge for everyone, but hopefully we’ll have a quick car and we can fight at the front. That’s the plan!”"}

It proved to be a particularly challenging year for his Alpine team, though, who struggled for performance early on and promptly shifted development resources to their 2026 challenger, leaving them at the foot of the Teams’ Championship.\nAs the campaign drew to a close, the Frenchman sat down with F1.com to assess his time at Alpine so far, why he is more confident than ever about the chances of ‘Team Enstone’ recovering and competing at the sharp end again, and how he feels ready to take the next step in his own career after nine eventful years in the sport...\nGasly has a group of local journalists huddled around him at Alpine’s hospitality unit in Mexico City – all listening intently as he talks about the highs and lows of his F1 career, what drives him on and off the track, and his passions outside the sport – when F1.com arrives to get ready for a separate interview.\nA few minutes later, the 29-year-old wraps up those duties, greets us and leads the way to a meeting room at the back of the building, where over the next half an hour or so – already in the mood to chat – he opens up on the past, present and future.\nThe quest for success at Alpine\nIt is difficult for us both to believe, but Gasly will soon reach a decade as an F1 driver, having arrived on the grid with Toro Rosso during the latter stages of the 2017 season, before establishing himself at the junior team and then earning promotion to the senior Red Bull squad – only for that move to be over in just 12 races.\nAfter resetting and rebuilding at Toro Rosso (later known as AlphaTauri), with whom he scored a memorable victory around their home Monza circuit in 2020, Gasly left the Red Bull family at the end of 2022 to begin a new chapter at Alpine, owned by automotive giants Renault.\nWhen Gasly walked through the factory doors for the first time, Alpine had just finished fourth in the championship and had their sights set on the big-hitting teams ahead, meaning regular podium finishes – and potentially even more – were the expectation.\nHowever, three up-and-down seasons – filled with managerial reshuffles and off-track noise – have seen them fall significantly short of those goals, with 2025 bringing a new low when Alpine dropped from sixth to 10th (and last) in the standings.\nSo, with a moment to reflect as another busy year winds down, how does Gasly review his journey with Alpine until now?\n“It’s crazy,” Gasly begins, pausing for thought. “It doesn’t quite feel like three years, maybe because I had to go through so many changes, whether it was the management point of view, the team structure, team mates… It almost feels like every time it’s been a fresh start – not the continuity of working with the same people.\n“There have been some clear highlights, like the podium in Brazil last year, the P3 in Las Vegas Qualifying last year, the podiums at Zandvoort and in the Sprint at Spa in 2023, but I think it’s fair to say that, overall, we’re quite far [away] from our expectations.\n“When I started at Alpine in 2023, the team had just come out of a very strong 2022 campaign, so I expected a lot more, which unfortunately didn’t happen.\n“But, if you ask me now, it’s the most confident I’ve been for the coming seasons, compared to the end of 2023 or the end of 2024. It hasn’t all been smooth and easy, but at the same time, I feel like we’ve been through the rough part of the journey, and much brighter days are coming.”\nWriting off the 2025 season\nPart of Gasly’s optimism comes from Alpine’s decision to effectively scrap further developments on their 2025 car early in the season and focus on 2026, when sweeping regulation changes – covering both power units and aerodynamics – come into play.\nA head start on the competition, if you will, even though there are “no guarantees” of success.\n“At the start of the year, when the team shared their approach and the fact that they would be keen to focus on 2026, I was the first one to say, ‘Just forget about this year. Even stop earlier and just start working on 2026’,” Gasly makes clear.\n“The reality is we are 10th in the championship. Let’s say we would have put a bit more budget and development [into the 2025 season], then we could have challenged for sixth or seventh in the championship – but we don’t do it for sixth or seventh in the championship, we do it to be right at the top.\n“This couple of months of development for next season could be the difference between being at the top or being in the midfield again for another few years. I was more than happy, even as painful as it’s been this year, to accept a tough season as a team, to make sure that we give ourselves the best chance.\n“Generally, I’m not a patient guy, but you’ve got to understand and figure out how to get the maximum out of a situation. We have no guarantees, but as a team I know our approach makes sense for what we’re trying to achieve, and to put us back on the map in F1.”\nFinding some stability\nMeanwhile, Gasly believes Alpine have finally found the managerial balance – under Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore and recently-signed Managing Director Steve Nielsen – to steer a workforce that boasts “great characters” and has “all the ingredients” required to succeed.\nA host of names have come and gone from top Alpine positions in recent seasons, including the likes of Otmar Szafnauer , Bruno Famin and Oliver Oakes , but Gasly still sees plenty of positives beyond the headlines and noise generated by these changes.\n“I say this with full transparency and honesty: we must have some of the best technical staff on the grid, looking at people’s experience, skill sets… I don’t think we’ve ever been in a situation with so many great engineers, mechanics and staff back in Enstone,” says Gasly, namechecking the factory that won titles under previous Renault and Benetton guises.\n“That’s why I’m filled with optimism, because when I look at the situation we are in, the people we have inside the team, and the brainpower we have inside this team, we have to perform. Surely it must all come together and it must work.\n“On Flavio, I think I connect with him because he has a winner’s mentality. He doesn’t care about anything other than winning. All he’s focusing on, all the time, is getting more out of us as a team – every single individual in the team. He doesn’t settle for anything less than perfection, and that’s my mentality as well.\n“We’re in a competitive sport and we need to aim for perfection at all levels – that’s the only way we’re going to get to where we want to be. Flavio’s won in F1, he’s won many other things in life besides F1, and I think that’s thanks to his mindset and approach. I can see he’s really putting his heart into the team and the effort to make it happen.\n“I also really like Steve. He’s a very different character to Flavio, but I think they complement each other a lot. He’s a great addition to the team in terms of leadership and experience, and being very factual and very objective: ‘If we’re good at something, we’re good, but if we’re weak somewhere, let’s not hide from it’.\n“I feel that we’ve got great characters across the team, and we’ve got all the ingredients to be successful. Now we’ve just got to make it happen.”\nA new engine for a new era\nThe third key point for Gasly when it comes to Alpine’s future chances is their switch to Mercedes power units – the manufacturer who stole a march on the competition at the start of the turbo-hybrid power unit era and have been heavily tipped to come up with another potent design this time around.\nIndeed, Mercedes won eight successive Teams’ Championships between 2014 and 2021, and powered McLaren to the last two titles, as well as claiming six Drivers’ crowns with Lewis Hamilton – and playing a part in Lando Norris’ 2025 triumph – across the same period.\nWhile Gasly is keen to recognise Renault’s efforts over the years, with their F1 engine department recently shutting down , he is naturally eager to experience Mercedes’ latest creation, which will also power the works team, reigning champions McLaren and Williams in 2026.\n“First of all, I think it’s important for me to thank all the people who worked [at Renault’s factory] in Viry-Chatillon, and who worked on the engine side,” Gasly emphasises. “There was a lot of noise, and it doesn’t really feel fully deserved for all the hardworking people who tried to deliver as much as they could.\n“Now we open a new chapter with Mercedes, and obviously, looking at their CV, how many times they’ve been World Champions, I’m sure it’s going to be a great adventure. I’m not going to lie, I’m very excited about it. From what I’m hearing, the engine is in a great place, so I’m looking forward to that first test and feeling what it’s like to have Merc horsepower on my back.\n“I have very high expectations for us as a team next year. We made tactical sacrifices on 2025 to reward all of us by starting on the right foot from 2026 onwards. That’s what I expect from us, and that’s what I believe we can achieve, from the people we have and the work we are doing.\n“Next year, I want to be fighting at the front of the grid. As it stands, I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t be able to be right up there.”\nGasly’s rollercoaster F1 ride\nShould Alpine’s new car and new engine deliver such a step, which is a lot easier said than done, it would also represent a full circle moment for Gasly, who has impressively rebuilt his career and reputation after a tricky first shot at the ‘big time’ some six years ago.\nAs touched on earlier, little more than a season into his F1 career with Toro Rosso, Red Bull chiefs promoted Gasly to the senior team in place of Daniel Ricciardo, who had made the bold and unexpected decision to join rivals Renault.\nIt was a baptism of fire for the youngster, who already found himself up against it after a pair of crashes during pre-season testing, and became the first of several drivers to struggle in the second Red Bull seat alongside Max Verstappen – the experience lasting 12 Grands Prix.\nGasly is philosophical as the topic comes up in our conversation, sharing more insight into how it unfolded on his side, the main takeaways, and how it has made him even hungrier for another chance to try and show what he can do in a competitive car.\n“For me, it was a very particular situation,” he says, again taking some time to think about his next words. “It can’t be seen as six months, 12 races, and ‘How did I do?’ in a very simple way, because there was nothing straightforward when I was there.\n“I could talk about it for hours. Is there a need for it? No. The chapter’s closed. Sometimes things work out and sometimes they just don’t. It’s obviously sad that it didn’t work out. At the same time, it wasn’t in my control. I know on my side I tried every single time to do my best with what I was given.\n“Unfortunately, it wasn’t made for two cars. You can argue that it works perfectly for Max, they’re doing an incredible job for him, but… I remember at the time I was with them, Charles [Leclerc] was in his first season with Ferrari, and we were discussing it a lot. It was a very different approach for two drivers with similar experience getting to a top team.\n“Anyway, I don’t really want to dwell on it. I’m very grateful for Red Bull and what they’ve done for me. Things could have been different, but at the end of the day, I also won a race with AlphaTauri afterwards; I’m one of two to have achieved that, alongside Seb Vettel, so I’m very happy to be part of that club. It wasn’t meant to be with Red Bull, but that’s okay.”\nNoting that “a lot of people thought I was done” when he got sent back to Toro Rosso, Gasly adds: “For me, it’s just about putting a lot of effort in. Sometimes people underestimate how much work you’ve got to do. I’ve never stopped grinding. I know what I want to achieve, and I know my potential.\n“I do feel that all these years have built a lot of fire inside me, and a desire to have my time. I see guys like Charles, Lando, George [Russell] – who I’ve been fighting in my career – getting their time to shine and their opportunities, and I need the car to be right up there with them.\n“We all get a different career, we all get different times, but I must say I’m eager to get to next year, and hopefully finally get my hands on a car that allows me to be fighting at the front with these guys. From the moment I have it, I know I’m not going to let it slip. I’m ready – I’m definitely more than ready for my time.”\nA reward for the hard work\nSo, with all of the above in mind, just how sweet would it taste to succeed at Alpine?\n“I think it would taste absolutely amazing,” Gasly smiles. “As I said, I believe in hard work, and that ultimately, if you do the right thing, the succession of right actions will eventually lead to the right outcomes.\n“For this team, as well, it would mean the world to get back to the top. I really like the approach of all our guys sticking together as a team, putting their best efforts in weekend after weekend, even when we have a car that is not competitive. No one’s giving up.\n“I feel it’s making us so united – to feel that sort of pain together, to accept it, and to not be divided. I think it’s building such a strength that when these better times come, we could have an incredible synergy, and really enjoy that ride together.\n“Obviously being French and representing a French brand is also something that I’m very proud of, and I want to put this brand and this team back to where they belong. Hopefully we can make that happen sooner rather than later…”"}

For sure on that side it will help [adapt to F1] because I'm used to being in this situation.\n\"But on the other hand, I haven't done Formula 1 yet so I don't know what's coming. We need to see and I need to be open minded and work hard because this step will be the biggest one I've dealt with so far.\"\nLindblad's F1 opportunity\nLindblad's ability to adapt to new machinery quickly, before effortlessly finding the limit, has been clear at every step of his progression through the junior ranks. He became the youngest-ever F3 race winner – and did the same when he stepped up to F2.\nWhile he didn't win those championships, and thus he knows he has more to prove, his speed, tenacity and quality of feedback was so good, Red Bull moved to ask for special dispensation for him to receive a Formula 1 Super Licence before he turned 18 so he could start getting used to the machinery as soon as possible.\n\"I always just thought that if I was just focused on the performance in F2, that was the thing that would give me the best opportunity [to step up to F1],\" he says.\n\"So that was always what I was focused on. I believed that if I did everything right and if I performed well, potentially there would be an opportunity. So all these things – with the Super Licence and the FP1s – were a bit of a confidence booster that I was doing the right things, that things were going well.\"\nThings were going very well. Red Bull put him in a two-year old Racing Bull three times to help him get up to speed – and he proved once again he was a quick learner.\nThey gave him his first taste of a Grand Prix weekend with F1 machinery when they ran him in FP1 at his home event at Silverstone, which he had to dovetail with his F2 duties.\nHe impressed both Red Bull and Racing Bulls with the way he handled those runs – but sources say it was his performance in his next FP1 opportunity in Mexico that really tipped the scales and convinced the energy drinks firm he was ready to become the 20th Red Bull junior to step into Formula 1.\n\"Silverstone was very special for me being my first time driving FP1 and obviously doing it at home as well,\" he says. \"It was challenging because I was racing in F2 at the same time so I couldn't put all my focus on the F1 because I had to perform well in F2 that weekend.\n\"But in Mexico on that side, it was a bit easier. There were no other commitments that I had. So, I was just focused on doing the best a job I could, which definitely helped. It still wasn't easy.\n\"Obviously with the situation, [Max Verstappen still fighting in] the championship, it was a lot of pressure to sort of not make any mistakes, but I was very, very happy with how both FP1s went, but especially Mexico.\"\n'There's a lot of things I need to work on to get up to speed'\nLindblad is aware of the mountain of work he needs to get on top of in the shortest winter Formula 1 has ever seen.\nThe Briton has been embedding himself in the Racing Bulls operation for around a year now, so already has a head start with getting to know the people and the infrastructure. But, while he will have more testing than most drivers get ahead of their debut, as there are three-pre-season tests next year rather than the usual one, he is entering the sport at a time when both the chassis and power unit regulations have just been overhauled.\n\"There's a lot of things I need to work on to get up to speed,\" he says. \"Going into Formula 1, there's going to be a lot of changes – not just from F2, but even more on top of that, because of the big regulation change next year, there'll be even more things to go through.\n\"So, I've got a lot of work with the team at the factory, on the sim and doing everything we can to try to get me up to speed because those tests will be really important.\n\"Next year even more so because the power unit is going to be a much bigger thing. There's going to be much more emphasis on that whilst driving. So, I think just really trying to get comfortable knowing what I have to do, what was required from me and to be able to sort of be comfortable to do it all.\n\"There's going to be a lot of things I'm going to have to think about whilst driving, so to try to sort of get up to speed on that and be comfortable doing it will be good.\"\nWhile it's certainly a big step up moving from F2 to F1, Lindblad's adaptability that he's demonstrated through karting into single-seaters could be one of his greatest strengths in helping him hit the ground running. Naturally, it's hard to give him performance targets as the pecking order of the teams is so unpredictable, but he knows that to impress, he just needs to show consistent progress.\n\"The advice [from his bosses Alan Permane and Peter Bayer has been that] things are going to be difficult,\" he says. \"I shouldn't be naive. I'm very aware of the fact that it will be a big challenge. It will be a really big step up.\n\"There's a lot of work I have to do over the next coming months prior to Barcelona [host of private testing to kick off pre-season].\n\"But even then, during all the tests, during the first part of the season, there's going to be a lot of things for me to be learning up to speed on. Even also on the team side, there will be that as well, because it's going to be so much that is new. We're all going to have to learn and develop together.\n\"It's just about being open-minded. It's nothing I already don't know that I need to just work hard and keep focused on myself.\"\nLindblad knows he's already impressed his Red Bull and Racing Bulls bosses by virtue of getting the seat.\nSpeaking at the time of the announcement, his Team Principal Alan Permane told me: \"His feedback is very good. He's intelligent – you can tell that when you talk to him. He'll learn quickly I'm sure. If a driver has got spare capacity, it's always good.”\nNow he's just got to show that in F1 on a consistent basis. Based on what he's shown so far in his career – and his rapid trajectory – all the signs are that he's up to the task."}

That played a big factor in the selection of Zhou.”\nWhy Zhou’s signing ‘made a lot of sense’\nZhou’s recent experience of working with Ferrari – who will supply Cadillac’s power unit and gearbox in 2026 – also went in the Chinese driver’s favour during the process of selecting a reserve.\n“I have a lot of respect for Ferrari,” Lowdon explains. “It's a team we've worked with before in the past; I know the people there very well. I know just how highly they valued Zhou's input in 2025, which was another big factor for us.\n“It also means that, in some way, that Zhou staying in that overall family, he's had experience of development and experience of the 2026 tyres, and also just experience in operating in a top-class, very competitive team.\n“So from our point of view, it just ticked all of the boxes in so many ways; the experience, the direct experience with Ferrari, who are our partner for the power unit and the gearbox, and so it just made a lot of sense for him to join the team.”\nThe move will also see Zhou reunite with Bottas, his former Kick Sauber team mate with whom he shared a good relationship – and this proved to be another element that appealed in bringing the 26-year-old onboard.\n“Another factor that we look for is the chemistry between all of the drivers, and we know already that the relationship between Checo and Valtteri is a really strong one – and I have no doubts as well that in selecting Zhou, based on seeing how he's worked with Valtteri over the last few years, that that working relationship would be very conducive to the overall goals of the team,” says Lowdon.\n“It kind of goes without saying that these guys are all very, very fast. We've said it a number of times before that we select all of the drivers in our programme on merit. We would have no qualms about any of these drivers getting in the car and racing in a Formula 1 Grand Prix.”\nHow recruiting the right reserve driver adds ‘a lot’ to a team\nWhile Zhou will not be on the grid in 2026, Lowdon – who has worked with Zhou as part of the Chinese driver’s management team – has stressed how crucial the reserve role is for Cadillac, particularly in terms of preparing for this season’s new wave of technical regulations .\n“Having a good, experienced reserve driver just adds that little bit extra to – or adds a lot extra, actually – to just how fast the team can both gel together and compete,” he explained.\n“That's another element I should mention; I've known Zhou for a while, so I know he's very, very committed. He's very much a team player, and that's absolutely what we need as a new team. He's very respectful and technically extremely knowledgeable and extremely good.\n“He has a very good feel for the car, and also a very good feel for what we think are the elements of racing that are going to be important in 2026 with all of the new regulation changes.”\nPrior to selecting Zhou for the position – in which his duties will include working closely with Bottas and Perez along with the wider engineering team, providing technical insight and carrying out simulator work – the team went through what Lowdon described in the announcement of Zhou’s signing as a “thorough” process in choosing the right candidate.\nWhen asked about what this involved, the Team Principal responds: “It actually goes back some time to when we were also looking at the selection of the race drivers for 2026. We spoke to a lot of drivers.\n“We are out of synchronisation with a lot of the other teams in terms of driver contracts, and so that actually meant that we had quite a lot of time to meet people, talk about different people's plans and just really select the best line-up that we can for 2026.\n“We've talked to a lot of drivers within the TWG and GM family, there are an awful lot of drivers as well, so we actually have direct relationships with a whole bunch of drivers. And that just gives us a really good opportunity to look at what is the best line-up going forward, not just in 2026 but looking ahead beyond that as well. I'm really, really happy with the overall line-up that we've got.”\n‘No competitive issue’ between Zhou and Herta\nThat line-up will see Zhou work alongside Herta, who will embark on his maiden F2 season as well as acting as Cadillac’s test driver. Does Lowdon expect Zhou’s experience to be beneficial in supporting the American racer?\n“I would hope so,” says Lowdon. “All formula move on year to year, but also there are elements that stay in the DNA of a particular formula, and obviously Formula 2 is a formula that Zhou competed in very successfully, and so I would hope that he'd be able to impart some of that knowledge onto Colton.\n“They’re team mates now, and everybody wants everyone within the team to do well, so I would hope that that's going to be an advantage. These are younger guys, still with plenty of Formula 1 opportunity ahead of them, both of them, so I can see that being a really productive relationship.\n“There's no kind of competitive issue here. Zhou is the reserve driver – he has a super licence, he's the guy who would jump in to replace one of the race drivers if needed. Colton doesn't have super licence – he qualifies as a rookie, therefore he can do FP1 sessions that Zhou can't do.\n“So there's some real synergy here, and I'm looking forward to working with a whole group of drivers – race drivers, reserve, test, sim drivers – all working together with the objective of maximising the potential of this brand-new team.”\nAs Lowdon touched on, Zhou still has the potential to make a return to the grid in the future; indeed, the driver from Shanghai spoke earlier last year of holding the long-term goal of making an F1 comeback.\nIn terms of what the future holds for the team’s new reserve driver, Lowdon believes that the position offers an ideal opportunity to keep Zhou at the “forefront of people’s minds in Formula 1, both in his role now and also potential opportunities for the future”.\n“It's incredibly difficult to get race seats in Formula 1 – we all know that,” he concedes. “But the best way to do that is to demonstrate speed and ability as a team player, and if you're not actually on the grid racing, then the next best platform to be able to do that is as a reserve driver.\n“We've seen that with Valtteri as well, in the position he's had at Mercedes in the last year. It means that you stay relevant, you stay connected. You understand exactly what's happening day to day with Formula 1, and in Formula 1 change is just at such an incredible rate all of the time that that's really important as well.”\nThe ‘start of school term’ vibe at Cadillac\nFor now Zhou’s focus will be on settling in at Cadillac as the squad get ever nearer to their debut, which will involve him spending time with his new team mates.\n“It's quite interesting at the moment, because it's literally only kind of in this last week that everybody's contractually free,” smiles Lowdon. “They've done all of their commitments from the previous teams, and so there's a real kind of start of school term feeling, and I think that exists amongst the drivers as well.\n“They all know each other really well. They'll all be together in the next few days with various activities, some engineering, some promotional, some marketing, and that gives them a chance to get to know each other further. But I think there's no shortage of interaction between them all and, as I said before, it's a really good chemistry mix.\n“Everyone knows what their role is. Everyone knows what they need to do. There's a real opportunity for everyone to excel and do well, and for the team to benefit from that as well. So I think going forward into 2026, I generally think we've got a really, really strong roster of drivers throughout the entire team.”\nLowdon describes the current mood in the camp as being the “normal mixture of excitement” along with the acknowledgement that “there's a lot of hard work ahead”, adding: “This is going to be a really, really, really intense season for the team, but it's just a massive opportunity for everyone involved.\n“It doesn't happen very often that you get a chance to have a new team coming into Formula 1, so if people weren't excited about that, then you'd have to have serious questions asked! But equally, everyone's experienced and so there's a recognition that we're not just here for fun. We're here to deliver the most competitive new team that we possibly can, and we know it's not easy.”\n‘It’s not our first rodeo’\nA few months ago, Lowdon set out Cadillac’s initial target as being to “execute as well as we possibly can and gain respect from the other competitors”. With more of the pieces having since fallen into place, does that goal remain the same?\n“Yeah, very much,” Lowdon answers. “We can't control what the other teams are doing or what they've done during the post season. It's been a very short post season as well. There's so many changes for 2026 that it's impossible to predict the hierarchy.\n“What's clear is that the challenge that we've had as a new team is really very unique, because we're just doing everything for the first time, and that is an enormous challenge which shouldn't be underestimated, and I think people should recognise that when they're looking at what the expectation for a new team actually is.\n“We're racing against teams where the youngest team on the grid has still a decade of Formula 1 racing experience or so, so I think that should set some expectation. But what we want to do is execute the things that we can control as well as we possibly can and measure ourselves against that.\n“And if we do that, we know that over time, we will build what we all want, which is a very competitive Formula 1 team. But to coin the American phrase, it's not our first rodeo for anyone involved, and so we have a huge respect for the task ahead.\n“It's super, super difficult, but we focus on what we can control and what we can do. Work as hard as we can and, the harder we work, hopefully the more competitive we become.”"}

At the end of a rollercoaster season, which featured early headaches, hard-fought breakthroughs, memorable podium finishes and a remarkable rise to P5 in the Teams’ Championship, he joined F1.com to review it all…\nIt’s the penultimate round of another busy F1 campaign and, while there’s the small matter of a Drivers’ Championship to be settled between the McLaren duo and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, plenty of racers up and down the Qatar Grand Prix paddock are already in a reflective mood.\nOne of those is Sainz , the experienced, multiple Grand Prix winner who was suddenly forced to rethink his career path in early 2024, when Ferrari dropped the bombshell news that they had signed seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton as his replacement for 2025 and beyond.\nSainz’s whirlwind first year at Williams\nAfter considering the many options in front of him, Sainz decided that the once-dominant Williams operation represented the best opportunity for success in the short and long-term, with team boss James Vowles working hard on a rebuild aimed at delivering a new race-winning and championship-contending era.\nThere has certainly been a lot for Sainz to get used to over the last 12 months, from a different factory to a different team mate, and a host of new colleagues to an all-new car, meaning it is no surprise to hear that his 11th campaign in the sport has passed in a blur.\n“It’s gone much quicker than I thought it would!” Sainz smiles as he sits down with F1.com at Williams’ hospitality unit in Lusail. “The fact that we are on the run so much in between races, non-stop… The sport is growing massively, so you do more marketing, more travelling, more races... By the end of the year, you cannot understand how it’s all flown by.\n“But, if you told me at the beginning of the year that there was going to be fifth position for Williams at the end of the championship, a good step forward, closing the gap to the top teams, and a couple of podiums, I would have taken it. It’s been a good year overall.\n“Also, when I signed with Williams in the summer of 2024, if I would have told people that I’m joining them because these results are going to happen, they wouldn’t have fully believed me. I have the results now to back why I chose this team – a vindication.”\nShort-term pain for long-term gain\nStandout results did not come at the click of a finger, though, with Sainz spending the first few Grands Prix of 2025 adjusting the FW47’s set-up, adapting his driving style and getting used to the outfit’s way of operating – all while new team mate and established Williams driver Alex Albon strung together his strongest start to an F1 season.\nSainz’s results over the first half of 2025\n“I’m trying so many different things with my set-up and my driving that for sure, you see progress,” he explained at the fifth round of 24 in Saudi Arabia . “Sometimes I try something, but I go backwards, and that then makes me go forwards, because I know which direction I don’t need to go in.\n“The same applies to my driving. I try little things with my driving style and the switches in the car, and sometimes I go backwards, but sometimes it helps me go forwards. It’s an adaptation process. I was warned it was going to take time, and it is taking time, but when I get it, I’ll be there.”\nSainz could at least draw on first-hand experience and perspective from several previous team moves – having made his F1 debut back in 2015 and spent almost three seasons at the then-named Toro Rosso (now Racing Bulls), before representing Renault for just over a year, McLaren for two years and then making the switch to Ferrari.\n“I’m a driver that, fortunately or unfortunately, has had to change teams quite often,” he underlines, as our conversation continues. “I’ve always been very vocal about how long it takes a driver to adapt to a new team, to extract the last couple of tenths out of the car, and to feel at one with it, but also with your engineers, with the rest of the team.\n“I feel like no one really bought that a few years ago when I was saying it. When I went from Toro Rosso to Renault, from Renault to McLaren, everyone was like, ‘Yeah, but you’re F1 drivers, you can do it’. The fact that so many drivers have recently changed teams, and everyone’s realised that it takes time – even the best ones take time to adapt – has kind of proven my point.\n“The reality is, with the talent and the speed there is nowadays in F1, when you’re up against Alex Albon in a Williams, Charles Leclerc in a Ferrari, or Max Verstappen in a Red Bull, they know the car by heart, so it’s very difficult to come in and immediately be at that level, as they’re already at the limit.\n“In the best case, you can match that and maybe improve it a bit, but in most of the cases when you’re new to a team, you’re going to be a step behind in every Free Practice session, in every Qualifying session, and in every Grand Prix.”\nAlongside this on-track push, made more challenging by a frustrating series of incidents and technical issues (Sainz’s mid-season assessment being “everything that could go wrong has gone wrong” ), there was a balance to strike with off-track efforts.\n“Because you are new to the team, there are all these extra simulator sessions, all these extra visits to the factory that you need to do, but there’s also all the extra marketing you need to do, because all the sponsors want you,” Sainz explains.\n“You end up being overloaded with too much simulator, too many factory visits, too many marketing things, so to combine that, plus to deliver on track, the energy levels are not easy to manage, and it takes a bit of time to find a balance.\n“To deliver in F1, you need a balance, and during the first six months in a team, there’s very little of that balance. So, you just need to stay patient, you need to trust the process, and you need to know that at some point, everything is going to click.”\nFollowing the leader\nOne man firmly in Sainz’s corner throughout this period of adaptation was Vowles, who spearheaded Williams’ efforts to secure the Spaniard’s signature in 2024 – fending off competition from the likes of Kick Sauber (prior to their Audi rebranding) and Alpine.\nWhen results were hard to come by on Sainz’s side of the garage, Vowles proclaimed to the media that he was still getting “more than I paid for” – pointing out the value his new driver had been bringing off the track, and insisting it would all come together on the track sooner rather than later.\nIt is a relationship that appears to have gone from strength to strength, with both parties naturally determined to make progress and move up the grid as quickly as possible, but sharing an openness and transparency that ensures there are no “nasty surprises” along the way.\n“After a tough end to 2024, with a lot of crashes, lacking parts, and being slow in Abu Dhabi, James was like, ‘Next year’s car is going to be okay. We’re going to be quick. It’s going to be a good step’,” says Sainz. “The moment we put the new car on track for testing in Bahrain, I realised how much of a big step the team had done.\n“But then, as much as he told me those positives, James also said, ‘You’re going to see some very big flaws that we have as a team at the moment’. He was very honest about it, he spoke sense, and he was very realistic.”\nExpanding further, Sainz adds: “The thing about Williams is there are so many areas where the team is closer to the top than what I would have expected it to be, but then I also found some other areas that we are very far behind. For me, it’s about being very vocal and very clear about the areas that are not good enough.\n“There are very big contrasts in this team. You have incredibly talented people, you have very good ideas, but then there are other things – processes, tools, simulation – where the team is really, really far behind. It’s how we accelerate the process, and everyone’s working flat-out to develop those weaknesses to make sure we are a top team.\n“I feel like the good thing is the management, in this case James and [ Dorilton Capital ], were always super honest to me about them. All of the [weaknesses] have been briefed, I haven’t found any nasty surprises, and I’ve just gone into it being realistic, knowing that the only thing I can do is give my best to try and help.”\nSainz, sealed, delivered\nIt makes what Williams ultimately achieved in 2025 even more impressive – the squad turning a lowly ninth position in the Teams’ Championship and just 17 points the season before into a high-flying fifth place and a significant return of 137 (their highest yield since 2016).\nWhile it was Albon doing the heavy lifting early in the year, Sainz more than played his part over the second half, returning from the summer break determined to apply the lessons he had learned and to put that aforementioned run of dramas behind him.\nAt the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, the breakthrough came, with Sainz starring in a tricky, rain-affected Qualifying session to place a brilliant second on the grid behind Verstappen, before converting that into a podium on merit across a dry race.\nMentally prepared not to feature on the rostrum for the foreseeable future following his Ferrari exit, Sainz emotionally erased that thought and gave Williams their first top-three finish since George Russell’s in the rain-shortened 2021 Belgian Grand Prix, and before that Lance Stroll’s at Baku in 2017.\nSainz’s results over the first half of 2025\n“I think there were two things about Baku that I really enjoyed,” smiles Sainz, who remains Ferrari’s most recent Grand Prix winner. “The first was obviously giving all the mechanics, giving Williams their first podium in many, many years, and probably the first podium for a lot of people who maybe were not there in 2021 with Russell.\n“Then, also for me, a bit more validation. It had been a tough first half of the year. I kept saying to the press that I was quick and I just lacked results to prove it, ‘Everything is going to come’, but the results were not coming my way.\n“When there was an opportunity for a podium, I grabbed it, and I could say, ‘This is what I came here to do’. I also felt so comfortable racing for a podium again. After six months of being away from the podium, you think, ‘Will I be a bit nervous or a bit rusty?’, but I took the chance and delivered.”\nContinuing the momentum\nSainz would deliver again during the Sprint in Austin and the Grand Prix in Qatar, giving Williams some more silverware to take into the winter – a period Vowles has long targeted given the huge regulation changes coming into play from 2026, and the opportunity those bring for all teams to launch themselves into contention in F1’s budget cap era.\nWith much-needed factory developments in the works, new tools and systems coming online, new hires making their mark across various departments, and a new Mercedes-powered challenger on the way, there is plenty to feel optimistic about at Grove.\nSo, what is Sainz’s outlook for the next phase of his and Williams’ journey?\n“The team is on an upward trajectory, and it’s fundamental to continue that trajectory – it’s important to keep showing progress, to not stall that progress that we are showing,” he comments.\n“Having said that, with such a big change of regulations, that progress might look different next year, because it’s going to be so unpredictable to know where everyone’s going to be. But I trust what the team is doing, I trust all the efforts that we’ve been putting into next year’s car through all the simulator sessions and all the development work.\n“I’m feeling positive. I’m relatively happy and confident about it, but with the impossibility to say more than, ‘I don’t know where we’re going to be’.”\nThankfully for Sainz and the rest of the F1 paddock, there is not long to wait and find out, with the first pre-season test taking place on his home soil at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in just over a month’s time…"}

Team Principal Alan Permane explains to F1.com why the duo will form his line-up for next year...\nRed Bull are giving Arvid Lindblad – the most exciting prospect from their junior programme – his shot at the big time after promoting him to a seat at Racing Bulls in 2026 as Liam Lawson wins a battle with Yuki Tsunoda to clinch the other drive. We speak exclusively to Racing Bulls Team Principal Alan Permane who explains to F1.com why the duo form his line-up for next year...\nRacing Bulls have long been a vehicle for Red Bull to develop their hottest prospects and see if they have what it takes to step up to the works Red Bull team and compete for Grand Prix victories.\nIsack Hadjar was given that shot this year, and while he crashed in his first race weekend, the Frenchman has since gone on to score 10 times in the Grand Prix format, including a superb podium in the Netherlands, and sits 10th in the drivers' standings heading to the finale in Abu Dhabi.\nThat form was too good for Red Bull to overlook so they promoted him to the senior team alongside reigning four-time World Champion Max Verstappen for next year.\nThat left at least one vacant seat at Racing Bulls. Keen to continue their strategy of giving talent a chance, Red Bull have wasted no time promoting Lindblad from F2.\nThe 18-year-old – who earned special dispensation to get his F1 Superlicence ahead of his 18th birthday earlier this year, having already accrued enough points to qualify – had three runs in a two-year-old Racing Bull this year ahead of two FP1 appearances for Red Bull in Silverstone and Mexico respectively.\nWhile he impressed in all his showings, Permane says it was his performance in Mexico that was a key factor in convincing Red Bull to give him a shot now.\n\"He had an exceptional outing in Mexico in the Red Bull in FP1,\" Permane tells me. \"He was very, very quick and both Red Bull and Racing Bulls were very impressed with that drive. It's lots of different things that have led to his promotion.\n\"[Red Bull Motorsport Advisor] Helmut believes in him – and that's a great thing to have, to have the backing of Dr Marko, who has been following his career closely.\"\nPermane adds: \"His feedback is very good. He's intelligent – you can tell that when you talk to him. He'll learn quickly I'm sure. If a driver has got spare capacity, it's always good.”\nWith Lindblad confirmed for one seat, that left just one left – with incumbent Lawson up against Tsunoda, who was set to lose his Red Bull seat to Hadjar.\nInitially, it is believed the Japanese racer was the frontrunner, but it was ultimately Lawson – who was demoted to Racing Bulls after just two races with Red Bull earlier this year – who got the nod.\nThe New Zealander had a slow start on returning to Racing Bulls but has since showed the peaks he is capable of with some strong drives, including P5 in Baku and P6 in Austria, as well as a double P7 in the Sprint and Grand Prix in Austin.\n\"Liam is talented, he's very talented, and my mission will be to get him to operate at the level he can operate at when things are all working for him,\" says Permane.\n\"In some of the most difficult situations we've had this year such as Vegas Qualifying or Baku Qualifying, he's excelled – and he's having some really strong races. I know he's capable of that and he knows he's capable of that and I just want to work with him to get him at that level every single time he goes in the car.\"\nPermane adds that if Lawson can iron out the peaks and troughs of his form and \"operate at his best level more consistently, he will be a very good Formula 1 driver\".\nLawson has made gains in the way he approaches a weekend, too. Previously, if he started a race weekend badly, he would likely struggle to recover. Last weekend's race in Qatar was another example to suggest he's found a way to iron out that fallibility.\n\"He had a difficult Friday, they didn't get things right but on Saturday he qualified better,\" says Permane.\n\"His pace in the race, if you look at the last laps – the only laps he was in free air – it was very impressive. He was faster than the three or four guys in front of him. The pace is there, we just have to link it altogether.\"\nIn keeping Lawson, Racing Bulls are afforded some stability heading into 2026, when sweeping new rules will be introduced for both the chassis and power unit.\nPermane says \"continuity really helps\" and he also pointed to how Lawson's near one-and-a-half years of F1 can help Lindblad settle in.\n\"Having a driver who will be able to also help Arvid is good,\" says Permane. \"It's something I've spoken to Liam about. I don't expect him to be a mentor for Arvid, far from it, but I do expect him to be there.\n\"OK he has only got a season and a half under his belt, but he has a lot more than Arvid has.\n“He should be able to – and I would expect him to – help Arvid out when things are tough for him, especially early on and during testing.\"\nWith Lawson and Lindblad locked in at Racing Bulls, Hadjar is set to take the next step in his already impressive career by joining Red Bull – something that makes Permane immensely \"proud\".\n\"It's part of what we're here to do as a team,\" says Permane. \"We like to be an incubator for talent, and that is on the driving side and also the engineering side.\n\"To see Isack move up to Red Bull Racing is great. It means they are happy that he is good enough and they have seen enough. I wish him all the success.\n\"He goes there full of confidence. I know he's looking forward to Abu Dhabi, to leave us on a high, and he feels the car will be strong there. He's just excited about his future.\""}

They have a mission target, to try to achieve over the years, and to bring Cadillac to a top midfield team and so on onwards, so that's what really attracted me.\n“On the other side, I think the team [saw] what I was able to do over the course of last year and what my role was, and I think it can really benefit both sides.\n\"So to be the team's only reserve driver, I feel like this is the best opportunity for me in order to be back behind the wheel, and at the same time I think what I am capable of bringing [in terms of] information and, together with two very experienced drivers, it just brings the team forward.\n“This year is a massive rule change, so all this knowledge, experience we’ve had over the years, this can be a help if you're comparing to a less experienced driver.”\nHaving ‘high trust’ in the Cadillac project\nIndeed, Zhou described the feeling of joining the team as being like “rejoining family” in the announcement of his signing, with Team Principal Lowdon having long acted as part of his management team while Bottas was the Chinese driver’s team mate throughout his time on the grid. It is the involvement of such experienced names that added further to his interest in the project.\n“We spoke a lot,” Zhou says of his relationship with Bottas. “We spent a lot of time [together], even when we were in different teams over the course of last year, so the three years I spent [in F1 were] really together with Valtteri.\n“But at the same time I always worked together with Graeme, and that's really what brings me the high trust over this project. I haven't worked with Checo before – I know he's a great driver.\n“But the three of us were always very honest people, and also we're very transparent with what's going on behind the scenes. So when you come into a massive chapter change over the rules, that's what you really need.\n“You need a team that can drive forward all together, rather than just focusing on an individual side of the garage for the, let's say, single benefits and results. All that is really important.\n“And as well, it’s a new team, so it just puts extra energy on it because you start from scratch. For me, it's also a brand-new experience I’ve never been [in] before. I’m excited for what's coming ahead, and looking forward to going back in the Charlotte factory, spend some simulator time, and also at Silverstone with all the engineers.”\nLearning from time with Ferrari\nAfter losing his spot on the grid with Kick Sauber at the end of 2024, Zhou returned to Ferrari – where he had previously been a member of the Driver Academy – in the role of reserve driver, working alongside race drivers Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton .\nWith the Scuderia providing Cadillac with their power unit and gearbox in 2026, Zhou believes that his experience of working with the Italian outfit will be beneficial, along with the fact that he previously raced with Ferrari engines during his time with Alfa Romeo/Kick Sauber.\n“Since this new era of Formula 1 introduced in 2022, I was only driving with Ferrari engines, which I got really used to, and also while I was testing development for Ferrari last season, I was also trying their 2026 engines, so all these things come into play together,” he explains.\n“I have a very precise idea and a feeling with feedback on how the engine, power unit, gearbox, everything works, and also the hydraulic system. When you change from engine to engine, that's also one of the biggest things you need to adapt as a driver, because the way you downshift, the way you drive, the driving style, it's going to be changing.\n“You need to adapt, which, for me, I will be already up to date. I'm looking forward to seeing what is the biggest difference this year, because it's going to be a big change. Even though we are a Ferrari power unit, I think every single manufacturer is going to develop over the years, so that's going to be very important.\n“I think this year is not about who can start on top; it's all about, throughout the season, who can put the most efficient hours in terms of wind tunnel development and to have the most efficient benefits on the aerodynamics or improvements throughout the season.\n“So that's what I’m looking forward to, and also I don't feel that I'm joining somewhere where everything I need to adapt to. I have the people I worked with, the engine the same and also, like I've mentioned, many staff and engineers I worked with over the course of the years. Everything just feels already like I’m familiar with everyone.”\nZhou also believes that joining Ferrari from Kick Sauber helped him to “learn a lot” and develop as a driver, explaining: “The decision made last year [to join Ferrari] was because I can learn so much from them.\n“For me, in 2024 I was fighting at the bottom of the field, and then when you're arriving into a top field team, you can see what they're doing as a team differently compared to what has been in the past.\n“It's not just how drivers react over the weekend, it’s also the way you are setting up the team, the way the constructor works in the factory, and all the little details really matter. So that's what I really learned, and I see the massive difference since day one I joined them. Now I'm understanding what it takes to be getting a team up to speed of fighting at the top, for winning victories or [becoming a] top midfield team.\n“That's very important, useful information, and I really enjoyed my time in 2025, that's for sure, because this is a year I learned so much from the team side, but also from the driver's side.”\nThe challenges of becoming a reserve driver and future goals\nOn the flip side of this, Zhou acknowledges that making the switch from being a full-time F1 driver to a reserve was not always the easiest adjustment.\n“It's challenging in terms of the mental side, just because you're watching all the people that are racing, and some of them you have battled with or you've beaten them throughout the years,” he concedes.\n“You want to be there, and you feel like you deserve to be on the grid fighting with them together. So that's probably the hard side, on the mental side, and when you’re just watching the race.\n“Then on the other side, I don't feel it's such a bad position, because while I was able to take a step down from a race seat over the 2025 season, I really felt the stuff I wasn't on the top performance level of, the stuff I would do differently if I go back on the grid again in the future.\n“When you're outside, you can just see a clearer picture of how you should develop, because you learn from both sides of the garage. Especially over the last year, I was able to be around two of the top drivers on the grid, to see what they're doing, and when they struggle or what they do well, what they've done differently, how they adapt, react.\n“All these things I'm taking into consideration, and I feel like it made me a better driver already. I'm just looking forward for the season coming together, but then also hopefully my ultimate goal is to be back on the grid, back behind the wheel, racing full-time.”\nThat goal of a comeback evidently remains on Zhou’s mind, but he admits that this is not a target that he is rushing ahead with as he focuses on his current journey with Cadillac.\n“I think generally it's not something I will think about every single week or monthly,” he explains. “While you are at the beginning of the season, you are just focused on the commitment you have, and my current commitment is with the completely new journey with the Cadillac F1 team.\n“For me, I think the ultimate goal is to be back on the grid, and that's the target. But in terms to achieve the target, sometimes you need a bit of a waiting game. You need to show the team what you can do over the course of the weeks, months, putting the effort in, and sometimes the opportunity appears, so I'm not fully rushing on that.\n“Right now, I'm actually looking forward to the next few weeks, few months, before the season.\n“Normally the period [for thinking about the future] is a couple of weeks before the summer shutdown. That's where you have to start talking about the future, so right now I'm just trying to take my [focus] into the team and then try to build on that.”\nHow Cadillac are approaching 2026\nLowdon has reiterated that Cadillac’s target entering into their maiden campaign is to “execute as well as we possibly can and gain respect from the other competitors”, and Zhou echoes these sentiments amid a season that poses unknowns over the pecking order.\n“I think when you have a new team, you can't say that when you get to F1 for the first race, you're going to be on top or you're going to be fighting for a top 10 easily,” the team’s new reserve driver explains.\n“It's about building on that. Many midfield teams started from scratch and they had to build on it, and it's all about getting the right people and putting the team in the right place, not rushing everything. I think on that side Graeme is doing a fantastic job.\n“Who knows [what will happen] – it's a question mark at the end of the day, because everything is so different with the regulations for this season, so you have no expectation for any teams. But what I can say is that how this team is looking over the course of the last few weeks and months, it's definitely in the right direction in order to make the team a lot stronger and better.”\nThere is little time to spare before some of those questions perhaps start to be answered, with three pre-season tests soon to take place before the campaign kicks off with the Australian Grand Prix on March 6-8.\nThe work begins now, then, for Zhou, as he gives an insight into what his first few weeks with the team will look like.\n“There will be simulator [work] going on,” he smiles. “I'll be finally meeting up with all the staff members in the team after this announcement. I’ve been waiting for this for a long time now – I’m, let's say, released in terms of I can just go there, start putting the hard work in, starting all the season from now.\n“I'll be very soon back in the factory, in the simulator, trying to give an idea how I feel and the comparison to all the recent and all the past experiences [I’ve had]. I’m looking forward to trying that and to meeting some new faces, some familiar faces, so everything will start very soon.”"}

Here’s everything you need to know about F1's 11th squad...\nEleven teams are set to line up on the grid for the 2026 Australian Grand Prix on March 8, with the Cadillac Formula 1 Team preparing to make their debut in the sport. Ahead of that, we take a look at everything you need to know about F1’s newest entry…\nSo, Cadillac are coming into F1 in 2026 are they? They certainly are sunshine. The American outfit will become the 11th team on the Formula 1 grid in 2026, joining the sport just in time for a raft of new technical regulations to be introduced (you can find out more about those here ). They are set to be officially known as the Cadillac Formula 1 Team, and backed by US car giant General Motors and TWG Motorsports.\nI see. So another American team on the grid then, along with Haas? You’ve summed it up to a nicety. As you say, it will mark the second American-registered team on the grid, joining Gene Haas’ outfit, who entered the sport a decade ago in 2016 – incidentally the last time an all-new F1 team joined the grid.\nBut hang on – Audi are joining the grid in 2026 and they’re new… Well strictly speaking, they’ve grown out of the Sauber team, so they’re not ‘new’ new, if you know what I mean.\nSort of. Okay, so Cadillac are coming in as an ‘all-new’ team then. Bit of a commute to most of the races from America though, isn’t it? Ah, well like Haas – who operate out of bases in the US, the UK and Italy – they’ve thought of that. Yes, Cadillac will be headquartered in the US – specifically in Fishers, a suburb of American motorsport haven Indianapolis.\nBut they also have a UK base which, like Aston Martin, is right next to Silverstone – and they’re also building a power unit facility near General Motors’ technical centre in Charlotte, North Carolina. But we’ll get to that in a bit…\nI bet setting up an F1 team from scratch is no mean feat, right? It’s no mean feat indeed – and to that end, they’ve got some experienced hands on the… tiller, is that the expression?\nIt’s a bit boaty, but I’ll allow it… Thank you… they’ve got some experienced hands on the tiller. Former Marussia Sporting Director Graeme Lowdon is set to oversee the squad as Team Principal, while other key figures include former Renault man Nick Chester as Chief Technical Officer, and Pat Symonds – formerly of ‘Team Enstone’ (read Toleman/Benetton/Renault etc) and Formula 1 – as Executive Engineering Consultant.\nCapital. And who have Cadillac chosen to pedal their first ever F1 cars? If it was me, I’d want drivers with a bit of experience… Well, I’m sure Cadillac would thank you for your input. As it turns out, they happen to agree with you, and in August 2025 announced seasoned racers Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez as their line-up for 2026 and beyond – with both drivers signed on multi-year deals. That gives Cadillac a driver pairing with a combined total of 527 Grand Prix starts, 16 Grand Prix wins and 23 pole positions, with both drivers having spent 2025 on the sidelines.\nNot too shabby. Didn’t they want an American driver though, being… well, American? The team are making no bones about their Americany-ness, but opted not to let that override their driver line-up decision initially.\nAs TWG Motorsports CEO Dan Towriss told us last August: “It's important to us to make sure there's a pathway for an American driver into Formula 1 and we'll be working on that. But I think for this inaugural season, for what the team needs, and… what [Perez and Bottas] bring, this was the right combination for our team.\"\nSo that means that for now, it’s Mexican Perez and Finnish Bottas at the wheel.\nWorthy of note, though, is that IndyCar winner and American person Colton Herta has been signed up as the team’s test driver, and has even opted to move from IndyCar to Formula 2 for 2026 as he seeks to make himself F1-ready in the future.\nI shall watch his future progress with interest. Now you mentioned something earlier about power units. So they’ll be made by… General Motors? Not yet. The current plan is for the team to become a full works outfit – as in making their own chassis and power unit – in the coming years, with the squad currently slated to have their own engine by 2029. Until then, they’ll have Ferrari power units (and gearboxes) in the back of their cars, along with Haas and Ferrari themselves.\nWell this is all tremendously exciting. When can I see these Caddies in action then? Don’t call them Caddies – you’re not Snoop Dogg. Cadillac are reportedly set for a shakedown of their car at some point in January, ahead of the 11 teams’ private test at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Spain on January 26-30, before official testing happens in Bahrain on February 11-13 and 18-20.\nCadillac will also officially launch their livery during the 2026 Super Bowl on February 8 (we mentioned they were American, right?).\nMeanwhile, they’ve already teased shots of Perez in the simulator , while Bottas began his first day as a Cadillac driver on December 9 2025, having wound up his duties as Mercedes’ reserve driver. His first task was getting a seat fit done, so that famous Finnish bottom should be nice and snug in the car come testing time…\nCan we keep Valtteri Bottas’ fleshy parts out of this, please? Sorry.\nBottom gags aside, shall we end on Cadillac’s targets for their first season in the sport? Sure. Sensibly, Lowdon and the rest of the Cadillac outfit have kept their feet on the ground targets-wise. Speaking to us last March , Lowdon said of his goal for 2026 and the coming seasons: “It's very difficult to quantify what success can look like other than we just have to execute as well as we possibly can and gain respect from the other competitors. I think that's always the first target because, if we do that, then we know that we will be doing a good job.”\nThere’s no doubt that the road ahead for Cadillac is long and the learning curve will be steep. But with good people behind the scenes and talented drivers on the track, the squad are confident they can build something big in F1.\nAs Bottas himself said – while acknowledging that their “starting point could be tricky” – “the sky's the limit for the team… [Cadillac] is going to be here to stay for a long time in F1.”\nThat’s a rousing note to end on. So Cadillac in F1 – one of surely many things to be excited about for 2026… You said it! And if you’re curious about some of the others, follow this link as Chris Medland talks new regulations, a potentially swirling morass of a drivers’ market and much more besides…"}

But don’t fret – we’ve got you covered for all the jargon you’re going to be hearing throughout the season.\nWith Formula 1 introducing new aerodynamic and power unit rules for 2026, here’s a rundown of the key new terminology you’ll be hearing when the new season gets underway…\nBoost Button\nAs has been the case for several years now, drivers can press a button at any point over the course of a lap to activate energy deployment. From 2026, this will be known as the Boost Button.\nWhen engaged, it will trigger a change in power unit power settings, either returning to maximum power or a profile configured by the team as per their personal choice. The boost could, in theory, either help them defend from a car behind or attack a car ahead providing they have saved enough charge. It can be used all at once or spread across the lap, depending on when they have the best chance to attack or where they are most vulnerable.\nOvertake Mode\nThis is new-for-2026. It’s a performance aid designed to deliver closer racing and boost overtaking opportunities. It can only be activated when a driver is within a second of the car in front at the detection point, which is nominally the final corner.\nIt allows a driver to recharge an extra +0.5MJ (megajoules) and generate an additional electrical power profile to allow them to sustain a higher speed for a longer period. It can only be used on the following lap. Its use will be most effective on longer straights as the delta speed it will deliver should have a greater effect on closing the distance between the two competing cars.\nRecharge\nCars will harvest energy to charge the battery when braking, on part throttle, when lifting off (when a driver lifts off the throttle early – often referred to as lift and coast) or when ‘super clipping’ (when some harvesting happens at the end of the straight when a car is still at full throttle – although this depends on the particular engine map being used, the circuit profile, and the overall Recharge energy allowance for that circuit, which varies as per the regulations).\nMost of the time, the Recharge will be automated by use of selectable Recharge maps and targets so braking, part throttle and super clip will all be automated functions controlled by the ECU.  The only Recharge mode the driver will have direct control of will be lift-off regen, whereby if the driver lifts off, then they can Recharge. However, doing this will disable the Active devices as well. In contrast, super clipping is still at full throttle and therefore the Active Aero will still be ‘open’.\nActive Aero\nFor the first time, F1 cars will dynamically adjust the angle of both their front and rear wings depending on where they are on the circuit (though it is true to say F1 did have adjustable front wings in 2009 and obviously the DRS rear wing from 2011).\nIn the corners, the flaps will be in their default 'closed' position to maintain downforce. They will move to their 'open' position to engage a low-drag mode, flattening the wings to reduce drag and increase top speed.\nThe rear wings can open on defined straights as with DRS now, though there will be more of them per circuit – and you don't need to be inside one second of the car in front to open them.\nThe drivers will manually ‘open’ the wings for each zone. Similar to DRS now, drivers can manually 'close' it or the wings will automatically close if they brake or lift off the throttle. There is an additional auto turn-off feature for 2026, whereby for certain zones there is also a lap distance turn-off to ensure that drivers can’t try to take certain corners with the wings ‘open’.\nThat will prevent incidents like Jack Doohan's off at T1 in Suzuka in 2025 ."}

Built to be inclusive and easy to pick up, the experience is accessible for all skill levels and open to guests ages seven and up, making F1 Arcade a rare destination where families, friend groups, and multigenerational teams can compete together.\nEach simulator features dual screens – one for the driver and an elevated spectator screen – allowing friends and colleagues to watch the race unfold in real time and cheer drivers on.\n“We’re excited to officially announce our Atlanta opening and welcome guests beginning February 6,” said Jonathan Peters, CEO of F1 Arcade. “Atlanta is a dynamic, culture-forward city, and F1 Arcade is designed to bring people together—whether they’re lifelong fans or brand-new to the sport — for unforgettable racing, food, and social experiences.”\nTo mark its Atlanta debut, F1 Arcade will introduce a limited Founder’s Club Card on opening day. Doors open at 5:00 p.m. on February 6, and the first 100 guests through the doors will receive a Founder’s Club Card, unlocking lifetime exclusive perks and experiences – including 50% off food for the first three months – designed to reward the earliest members of the F1 Arcade Atlanta community.\nWhat's inside?\nSpanning more than 15,500 square feet, F1 Arcade Atlanta features 68 state-of-the-art full-motion racing simulators, immersive audiovisual elements, and a refined, industrial interior, along with an expansive outdoor patio set to open in spring 2026.\nThe space is designed to reflect both the precision of Formula 1 and the raw, energetic character of Atlanta. Rather than a themed approach, the space embraces material honesty – polished concrete floors, expressive lighting, and a layout that encourages movement and discovery throughout the venue.\nBeyond the simulators, guests can test their reflexes on an interactive react wall and explore a series of visually striking moments, including neon circuit-style chandeliers and hand-painted tyre-mark murals by Atlanta-based artist Thomas Turner. Turner’s work brings a bold, visceral edge that grounds the global F1 Arcade brand in Atlanta’s creative culture, giving the space a distinct sense of place while remaining part of a cohesive international experience.\nThe ultimate group & celebration destination all year long\nDesigned for celebrations of every kind, from corporate events and client entertainment to birthdays, date nights, and friendly meetups, F1 Arcade Atlanta offers flexible event options including private rooms, exclusive spaces, and full-venue buyouts for up to 450 guests. The venue’s private Briefing Room accommodates up to 90 guests, with additional semi-private spillover space for larger parties.\nHere, guests enjoy exclusive access to dedicated racing simulators, along with a private bar, personalized service, and built-in AV. Throughout the space, team-based racing formats and shared leaderboards turn competition into connection, making F1 Arcade a standout group experience. Through F1 Arcade’s digital Arcade Hub, guests can track their racing scores over time, compare results with friends, and even opt into prize pools for the chance to win Formula 1 Grand Prix tickets.\nF1 Arcade simulators are powered by Motorsport Games’ rFactor 2 racing simulation platform and developed in collaboration with Formula 1 and Studio 397. Guests can race solo, head-to-head, or as teams, creating a highly social, adrenaline-fueled environment. Race day watch parties will give guests the chance to enjoy live Formula 1 Grand Prix broadcasts throughout the season, paired with food and beverage specials and the opportunity to jump into the simulators.\nTogether, racing, dining, live broadcasts, and interactive competition create a fully immersive Formula 1 fan journey that extends far beyond a single visit. With weekly programming and special events, F1 Arcade Atlanta becomes a year-round home base for Formula 1 fans and everyone in between.\nAs part of its commitment to the Atlanta hospitality community, F1 Arcade will also support The Giving Kitchen, a Georgia-based nonprofit providing emergency assistance to food service workers in crisis. During its first month of operations, F1 Arcade will support The Giving Kitchen by donating $1 from every Georgia Tow sold, which is Atlanta’s signature cocktail.\nPlan your visit\nRace reservations at F1 Arcade Atlanta open January 15, 2026.

For me what is particularly incredible is that we have had three different moments where everyone thought the championship was decided.\nFirst there was before the summer break where it looked like Oscar Piastri would be World Champion. Then in October, it looked like Lando Norris would get it. Then in the middle of November, Max Verstappen was on a mission and looked like he would win.\nThere's been some excitement at every race and we've had a lot to share with our fans from around the world. It's been a year of new fans who have joined the club, existing fans staying connected and new projects that were incredible, like F1 The Movie .\nI want to take this opportunity to thank all of the stakeholders and everyone who is following the sport and has a role in what we are doing. Everyone is crucial to the growth we are achieving.\nThe future of Formula 1 is bright\nCongratulations to Lando, Oscar and Max. In my eyes, they are all winners – and they've made for an incredible season. I'm sure they will continue to entertain us in the years to come, including doing battle with the next generation.\nWe had an incredible year for the youngsters. They have shown the grit and determination required to succeed in Formula 1.\nOne of the many examples of that came in Australia. Hadjar crashed on the formation lap and there were a lot of people saying he's not ready. Fast forward to today and he's stepping up to the Red Bull team alongside four-time champion Verstappen next season.\nFormula 1 needs people to be resilient. There is no other sport that commands the same kind of pressure. If you deliver, you will become one of the main protagonists in our sport.\nFormula 1 will continue to push the boundaries\nIt's an exciting time for Formula 1 right now. The growth is strong and everyone is asking 'What's next?' We will continue to propose ideas that are not conventional – and try to reach a dimension that was not traditionally born for F1.\nOf course, we want to keep the focus on racing. The sport is our beating heart and that is why there are new regulations coming next year. We will see brand-new cars with revised power units, which run advanced sustainable fuels.\nThe form book will be ripped up. The pecking order will be up in the air. And at the end of the day, the track will show where all the teams stack up. I'm pretty sure where you will rank in the first race, won't be where you rank at the end of the year, so fast and intense will be the development race.\nInterest in Formula 1 remains high\nThis is my fifth year in my position and if I look back at the evolution we have had, it is incredible.\nWe are working hard to pump up the spectacle off-track through entertainment, fanzones, sporting activations and music to support the main showpiece spectacle on track.\nVegas this year has proven what is possible. The city was not used to having an event like ours, but everyone has pulled together and now everyone is embracing the opportunity. Now three years later, it feels like we've been in Vegas for 30 years.\nNext year we will have Madrid joining the family and we are discussing with other countries about joining, too. Many want to be part of our show. We are working hard to evolve the schedule so that it is the more sustainable, too, in terms of the flow of races.\nI'm excited for the future. Thanks for all your commitment and all the warmth and love we feel from the fans. Stay tuned!"}

Which title contender will deliver in the decider?\nFormula 1 arrives in Abu Dhabi for the grand finale of the season, and Yas Marina could not be a more dramatic stage for a title showdown. With the World Drivers’ Championship still up for grabs and the top three – Lando Norris, Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri – separated by just 16 points, every lap, pit stop and strategy call carries enormous weight on track and in F1 Fantasy.\nAs the pressure builds under the floodlights, Abu Dhabi ’s blend of technical low-speed corners, long straights and rapidly improving grip will test drivers’ precision and adaptability. The circuit rewards smooth execution, tyre discipline and late-season composure, providing a fitting backdrop for a winner-takes-all showdown in F1 Fantasy.\nEven with the last round of the season upon us, it is still not too late to join the free-to-play game and compete for the great prizes on offer every race week! New players will need to select five drivers and two constructors within the starting cost cap of $100 million.\nThe Alpine Desert Dash mini-league also enters its final week, giving managers one last chance to join and compete for exciting prizes, including the winner getting a virtual meet and greet with Pierre Gasly or Franco Colapinto.\nAhead of every Grand Prix weekend, our F1 Fantasy Strategist evaluates seven in-game assets – five drivers and two teams – that can help you succeed in F1 Fantasy, whether that’s eking out every point or maximising your budget.\nAbu Dhabi is a venue where Qualifying tends to shape the race, with a high emphasis on tyre management as the track rubbers in through the evening. Drivers with strong one-lap pace and teams with steady long-run form are often the safest hands with everything on the line.\nGiven how tightly matched the three Championship protagonists are heading into Abu Dhabi, the Strategist has considered an unconventional line-up structure this week to uncover new opportunities for players to score points, determine their 2X DRS Boost driver and climb their mini-league ranks.\nCatch up on the Qatar Grand Prix highlights below and remember to lock in your teams before Qualifying begins on Saturday, December 6 at 1800 local time (1400 UTC).\nLando Norris ($30.3m)\nA victory in the Qatar Grand Prix would have secured Lando Norris the Drivers’ Championship – but he may have to wait one more week to lift the trophy after only managing P4 last time out.\nThe McLaren racer has five consecutive front-row Grand Prix starts and is tied with Max Verstappen , his closest title rival only 12 Championship points adrift, for the most pole positions this season (7).\nIf Norris finishes on the podium at Yas Marina, he is World Champion. He leads all drivers this season in Grand Prix podiums (17) – a very promising sign.\nThe Briton secured pole position and the Grand Prix victory in the final race of 2024 and will be targeting much the same to secure his maiden Drivers’ Championship.\nMax Verstappen ($30.1m)\nThe Qatar Grand Prix served as another reminder that Max Verstappen is inevitable – despite starting P3 in the Grand Prix, the Dutchman capitalised on a McLaren strategy error and charged towards his 70th career win, bringing him to within 12 points of rival Lando Norris ($30.3m) in the Drivers’ Championship.\nThe Red Bull driver is arguably the most in-form title contender, notching five Grand Prix victories in his last eight race weekends.\nMost encouragingly for his chances, the 28-year-old has converted pole position to a Grand Prix victory at Yas Marina circuit all four times he has started P1. The polesitter in Abu Dhabi has gone on to win the last ten Grands Prix at this circuit.\nWith the title at stake and Verstappen needing to deliver a masterclass across the weekend to land on the top step, expect nothing less from the four-time World Champion.\nOscar Piastri ($25.1m)\nThe Qatar Grand Prix was a difficult one for Oscar Piastri , who appeared destined for a race win prior to a misjudged strategy call by his pit wall team, with Zak Brown and Andrea Stella admitting they “made the wrong decision” with keeping both McLaren drivers on track during an early Safety Car.\nPiastri looked primed to deliver his strongest weekend in recent memory, topping every session across the weekend up until Sunday.\nDespite finishing runner-up to title rival Verstappen in the race, Piastri posted his second-highest score of the season (46). This was helped by his sixth fastest lap (+10 fantasy points) of the season, a scoring category he leads all drivers (tied with Norris) in 2025.\nPiastri’s more affordable entry point compared to his championship rivals makes him an excellent 2X DRS Boost alternative for lower-budget F1 Fantasy teams this weekend or those looking to take a punt.\nYuki Tsunoda ($11.4m)\nRed Bull confirmed on Tuesday that Yuki Tsunoda will not return to the grid in 2026 , bringing his 22-race stint with the senior team to a close.\nHe arrives in Abu Dhabi buoyed by a season-high P5 in the Qatar Sprint and a competitive average of 14.4 fantasy points across his past five weekends.\nThe Japanese driver also claimed a career-best P4 at Yas Marina in 2021, the most recent occasion the Drivers’ Championship went down to the final race of the year.\nAnd with emotions likely to influence Driver of the Day voting, a tidy 10-point bonus in F1 Fantasy, he remains an intriguing high-upside pick for the finale.\nNico Hulkenberg ($5.0m)\nNico Hulkenberg hasn’t rediscovered the magic of his Silverstone podium – or the 45-point fantasy haul that came with it – as inconsistency and DNFs have marred his run since the summer break, with only a single double-digit score in Las Vegas to show for it.\nYet Abu Dhabi has historically been kind to him. Five top-10 finishes at Yas Marina, including P8 for Haas last year, suggest there’s still meaningful upside.\nThe Kick Sauber veteran remains one of the strongest movers on race day, ranking second for average positions gained (2.8) and fourth for overtakes (3.7) per Grand Prix, heading to a circuit that has featured among the top four for overtakes in each of the last three years.\nOwned by just 5.6% of the Global Top 500, Hulkenberg is one of the standout low-ownership plays for managers chasing a late surge.\nOther drivers to monitor: Kimi Antonelli, Liam Lawson\nWilliams ($19.5)\nWilliams have closed out 2025 strongly, notching two podiums courtesy of Carlos Sainz ($7.7m) since the summer break.\nThe Grove team average 29.2 points between COTA and Qatar, the most among teams priced under $28m in that period of time.\nAt a circuit ripe for overtakes, this plays to the strengths of both drivers – Sainz and Alex Albon ($12.6m) average a combined eight passes per race weekend, good for second on the grid this season among all teams.\nWith an ownership of only 0.6% among engaged players in the top 500, Williams is an enticing differential for the 2025 curtain call.\nRacing Bulls ($16.2)\nWith the last week of the season arguably the most popular time to roll the dice on differential assets, the Racing Bulls constructor enters the conversation after a string of good recent results.\nThe Faenza team is the fourth-highest scoring team between Brazil and Qatar, averaging 33 F1 Fantasy points thanks to the point-scoring heroics of both Isack Hadjar ($6.9m) and Liam Lawson ($5.9m), who were both recently announced that they would be returning to the grid in 2026 .\nRacing Bulls also offers routes to points beyond the traditional of means of overtakes and gaining positions – staples of midfield constructor teams. They average 6.8 points for fast pit stops and 5.8 points for Qualifying teamwork, marks they lead all teams priced under $28m in.\nIf you are tempted to explore something different to the traditional two premium-priced constructor pairing in the last race of the season, Alan Permane ’s team is certainly one to watch.\nOther constructors to monitor: McLaren, Red Bull\nAs always, be sure to keep a close eye on the earlier sessions to help guide your decisions for drivers and teams in the lead up to the team lock deadline."}

Obviously, I was disappointed. It’s tough.\n“At the same time, I’m not fully recognising or fully feeling it yet that I’m not racing next year. It’s surprising that I was kind of okay the next morning – I was thinking about Abu Dhabi. It’s not ideal.\n“What I’ve got to do here is exactly the same, what I was trying to do in Qatar. It’s to be competitive as much as possible and ideally help Max [Verstappen] and finish as high as possible for myself and the team.”\nTsunoda started 2025 at Racing Bulls, having been overlooked for a Red Bull seat during the winter, but he finally got his chance at the senior team in a swap with Liam Lawson two rounds into the campaign .\nHowever, the struggles Lawson and a long list of previous Red Bull drivers experienced alongside Verstappen were also seemingly felt by Tsunoda, who has endured a spate of early Qualifying exits and had to settle for occasional minor points.\n“I’m not saying I don’t have regret at all,” said Tsunoda, pondering his early-season promotion. “I’m missing the Racing Bulls car, which part of the car I developed since the regulations started. Some DNA is in there and you throw out your baby. So, I missed that and kind of regret that.\n“At the same time, I don’t mostly regret it. I kind of understand it why this seat is a little bit difficult, but at the same time I think, towards the end especially, the team gave me a lot of support.\n“I think at the last few races, it looks like I’m struggling, because sometimes I was exiting Q1. If you look at the result, it’s a lot different, but I see consistently the difference between me and Max. I can’t remember the last time I was four-and-a-half tenths back.\n“I’m pretty happy with it. I jumped in in the middle of the season, he drove this car for four years, and being this close is something [of a] different situation to a lot of drivers who were driving [here] before.”\nAs for what the future might hold alongside or beyond his F1 test and reserve duties, Tsunoda said: “I leave it to my manager and I only think about Abu Dhabi. Let’s see how it goes with the race.\n“It will be a new experience for me. The last few years I’ve been racing. I will miss [it], for sure, but I think at the same time I can see a lot of new perspectives being inside both teams, learning a lot of things I never even imagined.\n“Let’s be positive. I’m just thinking about Abu Dhabi, and let’s think about the future afterwards.”\nPushed on whether a move to a series such as IndyCar could be an option, he said: “F1 is my life. It’s too early stages [to think about anything else].\n“For now, the only motivation I have is F1. I’m not really thinking about that competition for now, but I’ll do as much as I can with any opportunity to make myself sharp.”"}

You found an enormous amount of lap time in Q3 there. Where did that come from?\nMax VERSTAPPEN: Well, in Q2 I stayed on scrubbed tyres and I think those laps already felt quite decent. And then in Q3 around here, you know, the track temp is coming down. You know that you can push a bit more and that's exactly what we did. We found a bit more lap time and, of course, incredibly happy to be in first. That's the only thing that we can do, right? That's the only thing that we can control, try to just maximise everything we have and then do what we can with the car – and we definitely did that in qualifying.\nQ: Max, conditions in FP3 were so different from what you see in qualifying. What's the challenge like for you and your engineers to decide what changes to make to the car knowing that when you get on track in qualifying, it's going to be so different than what you saw in practice?\nMV: Yeah. You have to try and guess a little bit how much the track is going to improve. Of course, it cools down a lot. But you're never like 100% sure if it's going to work. But I do think that what we changed definitely helped me a little bit more to feel better in qualifying.\nQ: Lando Norris starts outside of the front row. You guys are really writing the script for us – all three of you starting one, two, three. Lando, you're ahead of one championship rival, behind the other. Are you satisfied with how you did out there? Did you leave anything on the table?\nLando NORRIS: It's tough. I mean, Max did a good job, so congrats to him. We did everything we could. I think my lap was pretty good. I was pretty happy. So yeah, of course disappointed to not be on pole for the final weekend, but we were just not running fast enough today. So, we'll have to try do it tomorrow.\nQ: A podium tomorrow clinches the world championship for you. Is that then the goal? Are you just thinking about finishing on the podium or is it still going for the win?\nLN: I don't know. The time will come when I think of that. But for now, you know, disappointed to not be on pole, and I still want to try win tomorrow. So that's going to be the goal.\nQ: And Oscar, for you, great effort throughout. You were very quick in Q1, came up a little bit short in Q3. How was the run for you?\nOscar PIASTRI: Yeah. I mean, I think it was pretty good. I think the lap I did in Q1, it was nice to finally get into a rhythm through the weekend. And honestly, I think the last lap in Q3 was pretty good as well. There wasn't a whole lot left in that. No, just not quite quick enough today. But yep, sets up a pretty exciting day tomorrow.\nQ: Qualifying pace is one thing. Obviously race pace is a completely different thing. Do you think you've got what it takes to get by these two guys tomorrow for the win?\nOP: We'll find out tomorrow. I think Max has looked very quick in the long runs this weekend and clearly very quick over one lap. But yeah, let's see how much pace is a factor tomorrow.\nQ: Max, finally back to you. Obviously, a win essentially is all you can control, like you said. Is there any point worrying about what's happening behind you or is it just eyes forward for 58 laps?\nMV: We'll find out tomorrow, won't we? Let's see what we can do. Of course, I'll try to win the race, but also in the back of my mind, we want to try and score a lot of points to still try and win that championship. So, we need a bit of luck from what is happening behind us.\nPRESS CONFERENCE\nQ: Max, very well done. Two laps good enough for pole this evening. Tell us about the performance, first of all. How good was the car? How clean were those laps?\nMV: Yeah, I think in general, qualifying felt a little bit more together compared to the other sessions, where I always felt like we were still lacking a little bit. But then I think with the final changes that we made going into the night, that seemed to help us a bit. And then throughout qualifying, just improving nicely. In Q2, of course, I was on scrubbed tyres, and to be honest, I was a little bit surprised on the first run how much the new tyres actually gave me. But yeah, it was a good lap already, with a little bit of help also from Yuki with a tow. So, that was very nice of him to give up one of his runs. And then the second lap, I was not sure if I was going to improve just because of the tow that I got. But then again, just found a little bit more lap time in the corners, and that gave me a little bit more lap time. So happy with that, happy with the one-lap performance at the end in qualifying. Now, of course, the big question mark is can we keep that up in the race.\nQ: Well, can you? You said that qualifying went better than the practice sessions. Have you got the long-run pace that you need?\nMV: I would hope so. I mean, I actually did a lot of laps in the long run, so we tried to prepare in the best way possible. It's probably the best I have felt, but of course, let's see if that's good enough.\nQ: So, huge race tomorrow. You have your title rivals alongside you and directly behind you. First up, how much are you going relish this battle tomorrow?\nMV: Of course, I'm excited. I'm looking forward to it. I'm going to try to win that race. But of course, with that, I still need a little bit of help or luck to win the championship. But we'll see how that goes tomorrow.\nQ: And how much will you agonise about the different permutations that you need tonight? Just what you need to win the championship—how much will you look to that tonight?\nMV: To think about that tonight? No. We'll figure it out tomorrow, not tonight. I mean, it's like talking about strategy—you can talk about it for one hour, two hours, and then normally after one lap, you throw it in the bin. So, yeah, a lot can go well for you, can go against you, and we'll find out tomorrow.\nQ: Lando, let's come to you. You said a moment ago you're disappointed not to be on pole. So, let's talk about Q3. How was the car? How was your rhythm out there?\nLN: Yeah. I think Q1, Q2, not the smoothest. My Q3 laps, I was pretty happy with, honestly. So yeah, I felt pretty good. I felt like I got a lot out of the car today, but it just wasn't enough. So, a bit disappointed because you just want to be on pole for the final race of the year. But we just didn’t have the pace today. So, I felt like I got the maximum out of the car, and I have to be happy with that. Of course, behind the one person I kind of want to be ahead of—that’s the only reason for the disappointment. But otherwise, I was pretty happy with my laps, and yeah, it was the maximum we could do.\nQ: You used two sets of tyres early on. How much did that upset the rest of the session for you?\nLN: No, it didn’t.\nQ: Let’s throw this forward to the Grand Prix itself. First of all, the long-run pace of the car—what did you learn in Friday practice in particular?\nLN: Bits. I think we weren’t in the best position on Friday. I think we've improved in quite a few areas since then. And race pace, you know, normally we're pretty strong. But like Oscar said, Max’s pace was also very strong. So yeah, I think today when you look at it, we weren’t quite quick enough. But of course, we'll hope we can turn some of that around tomorrow.\nQ: So how do you balance taking risks in this race with protecting your championship lead?\nLN: I'll decide when I have to.\n1 / 5\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Max Verstappen of Oracle Red Bull Racing and The Netherlands celebrates pole position during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Peter Fox/Getty Images)\nQ: Oscar, it was very close between you and Lando in qualifying. Let's talk about your one-lap pace first of all. How pleased were you?\nOP: I think overall, pretty happy. I feel like Q1, that was the first lap that was actually good for the weekend, which was nice to have it at the right time. And then I think the laps in Q3 were pretty good as well. You know, the tiny little margins that you always have on a qualifying lap were probably there, but I didn’t have an answer for Max’s pace today. So ultimately, pretty happy. Would have loved a bit more, but we didn’t have it.\nQ: And are you happy with the long-run pace of the car?\nOP: Difficult to know. I've not done that much long running, obviously only FP2, but it looked okay without being anything spectacular. So yeah, I would have loved the long runs to have gone a bit better, but we're here now, and we'll see how the conditions and the track evolve.\nQ: Now you've won championships before, obviously, as has Lando in the junior formulas. Is there anything you've learned from previous high-pressure moments that will help you tomorrow?\nOP: Yes. Funny things can happen. That’s what I've learned.\nQ: Going to get your popcorn out and watch these two going into Turn 1 tomorrow, for example?\nOP: Turn 1, I don't know, but I'll have someone stand by.\nQUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR\nQ: (Scott Mitchell-Malm – The Race) Question to all three. Based on the long runs in FP2 and how the track has felt through today, how much do you feel it's gripped up from yesterday, and what's that going to do in terms of the demands of the car? Because a lot of people were talking about front graining on the front right and then deg on the rears.\nMV: Normally, it always improves a bit. It's quite natural throughout the weekend. But still, I think everyone in the long runs was graining their right front, and at the same time, the rears are also not on holiday. So yeah, I think we will all struggle with the same thing—but some a bit more than others.\nLN: Max summed it up pretty well. I think the track certainly improves always into qualifying. Probably not as much as we might have thought considering yesterday, with where the fuel loads we were at, things like that. It was already a 23.0, I think. So, we didn’t really go that much quicker today with a lot less fuel. So I maybe would have hoped for a bit more from us today in quali performance. But lately, our quali performances have been something that have been a bit more on the back foot rather than the races. So yeah, like Max says, I think everyone struggled with similar things. But generally, people try and work on those things as much as possible into FP3 and so forth. And normally, the grip coming up then also helps that into Sunday.\nOP: Yeah. I don't have much to add. I think it has gripped up quite a bit. I think for everyone, it was probably a bit worse than expected. So, we'll see what that looks like tomorrow.\nQ: (Carlo Platella – FormulaPassion.it) Question for Max. You mentioned the improvements you and the team made since yesterday. What were the main struggles you experienced yesterday with the car?\nMV: Just being able to put it all together. Sometimes that’s oversteer, sometimes that’s understeer. Just depends a little bit on the corner layout. And every session you try different things—some bits are positive, some bits are negative. And then over the practice sessions, you make a call on what you want for qualifying. That’s what we did, and finally most of the corners came together.\nQ: (Phil Duncan – PA) Max, back in 2016 when Lewis was trying to win the title, he tried to back Nico up into the pack so that he would fall down a few places. Is that a tactic you're considering tomorrow and one you might be up for exploiting? And Lando, are you prepared for what might not be a very straightforward race in that respect?\nMV: Yeah. It was also a different layout. I feel like now you get towed around a lot more around the lap, so it’s probably not as easy to do something like that. Cars also are completely different to back then. I felt like it was a lot easier back then to back it up because the tyres would overheat a lot when you would get close. I remember even in 2016, in some qualifying laps, you couldn’t go flat out in Sector 1 to keep the tyres alive in the last sector—which actually was here, for example. So yeah, very different times. I hope it’s not straightforward, the race—but hopefully that’s not because of me!\nQ: Lando? Are you expecting a complicated race?\nLN: No idea. I expect everything, so we’ll wait and see.\nQ: (Julian Linden – Herald Sun) Question for Oscar. Are you cool with team orders now if you can’t win? And if by chance it turns out that you do something which helps Lando win the championship, how would you hope or expect he might thank you or repay you down the track?\nOP: I don't know. Handshake would be good, probably. I don’t know. I haven't... I don't know what exactly is expected of me yet. But until either Lando or Max cross the line in front of me, I’ve still got a chance of winning the title. So yeah, we’ll see how the race pans out.\nQ: (Laurence Edmondson – ESPN) To Oscar, are you expecting those conversations to happen before the race tomorrow? Is that the normal process? And to Lando, you mentioned on Thursday how much the championship would mean to you—was there any difference in the way you felt ahead of that qualifying session?\nOP: I’m sure we will talk about it. Yes. I think it makes a lot of sense to talk about that one before the race.\nLN: No. I mean, I'm always a bit nervous before quali. It's more excitement than anything else. But apart from Q1, I felt pretty good out there. So no, I felt pretty normal.\nQ: (Tim Hauraney – TSN) Max, where does this qualifying lap from yourself, your final push lap, rank for you all-time, and was it close to perfection from you?\nMV: Yeah. It felt really good, and of course there was quite a bit of pressure trying to do the best we could. It felt probably similar to 2021 qualifying—I had a really good qualifying here as well. But I like that. When the pressure is the highest or when you really need to perform, normally I perform because I enjoy that kind of aspect. But yeah, it was nice. You always try to do the best possible quali lap. Sometimes it works out better than other times. I think this time it worked out pretty well.\nQ: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Lando, in the build-up to Qatar you could have won the championship there on Sunday. How did going through that experience, in terms of nerves, pre-race build-up, help you going into this weekend?\nLN: I mean, it feels a bit different, just because it's the final race of the year, not because of anything else. I felt pretty normal into Sunday last week. I didn’t really have the expectation that I was going to get the championship because I started P3 and just didn’t really expect it. Or P2. So no, I felt good then, I feel good now. I feel comfortable and ready to go. I feel like we’ve got a good plan for things. But as Max said, you can’t plan for everything. So no, I feel good. I feel excited to get the final race done and then go on holiday.\nQ: (Mat Coch – PlanetF1.com) To the two McLaren drivers: tomorrow there's a good possibility that one of you is going to be very happy and one perhaps a little bit less happy. Have you guys discussed that?\nOP: I don’t think you need to have any discussions about things like that. One of us could win our first championship in F1—you’re obviously going to celebrate that. I think we've got more than enough respect between each other to appreciate the work of the person that loses tomorrow, and there’s going to be nothing but respect either way. Also, whoever's on the losing side – it would be unfair to expect the person who’s won to not celebrate. So, I don’t think you need any conversations. I think we’re adults and got enough respect between us to know what’s right.\nLN: Yeah. Oscar said it well. It’s not a conversation that needs to be had, and I think we both understand each other and are respectful enough of one another. I think we both understand that no one would do anything in a bad way to make the other feel worse. We both respect what we do every single weekend, every quali, every race. We go out and race together. But that’s the same off the track—we're two different guys that get along, and that’s all we need.\nQ: (Maria Guidotti – GrainingF1.com) Lando, two questions. Would you sign to finish tomorrow the way you finished today? And in an ideal situation approaching a season, is it better in terms of mindset to be the hunter or the hunted?\nLN: I don't mind either. I’ve been in both positions, I guess. I felt good in both. I performed in both. So yeah, I’m not too bothered to be the hunter or the hunted. I think normally to be hunted is fine because you’re normally the one with the advantage in the first place, so that’s good. And of course, I would sign for that now but life’s not that simple, sadly. So, I’m still going to go into tomorrow and we are still going to plan for how we can win the race, whether it’s on pace or strategy or whatever it may be. That’s all going to be our plan tomorrow, and that’s how I want to end the season—standing on top. So, nothing changes from that side.\nQ: (Dzhastina Golopolosova - Momentum Racing) How much of tomorrow will be decided in the first few corners? And are you ready to take the maximum risk if needed? This question to all three drivers.\nMV: All out. I have nothing to lose. So for me, of course, I’m going to try to win the race. I’m going to defend. If I need to attack, I’ll attack, because what can happen? You’re either second or third – or you win. That would be fantastic.\nLN: I mean, it’s not something you decide now, honestly. It’s something that you'll see and decide before the start of the race and five metre s before you brake into Turn 1. Until then, I think everyone just wants to get the maximum out of it for themselves.\nOP: Yeah. I mean, from where I'm sat, I need things to happen in the race to win the championship. So, I’ll wait and see if those things happen."}

Max Verstappen (Red Bull), 2. Oscar Piastri (McLaren), 3. Lando Norris (McLaren)\nTRACK INTERVIEWS\n(Conducted by David Coulthard)\nQ: Lando Norris, you are a world champion! The world champion!\nLando NORRIS: The world champion. Oh, God. I've not cried in a while. I didn't think I would cry, but I did. It's a long journey. First of all, I want to say a big thanks to my guys, everyone in McLaren, my parents. I'm not crying. My mom, my dad, you know, they're the ones who supported me since the beginning. Oh, I look like a loser!\nQ: You look like a winner to me. You're only the 35th man to win a Formula 1 world championship. This is the biggest prize in motor sport.\nLN:  I mean it feels amazing, you know. Yeah. I now know what Max feels like a little bit and I want to congratulate Max and Oscar, my two biggest competitors the whole season. It's been a pleasure to race against both of them. It's been an honour. I've learned a lot from both of them as well, so I've enjoyed it. It's been a long year. But we did it. We did it. And I'm so proud of everyone.\nQ: Look, it's been an incredible season. It was so tight between you all. You were feisty in that race as well. We were curious to know, would you sit back and not take any risks, but you pulled off some good passes, did what you had to do. How much of that world championship was in your mind when you were running in third and how much is it just in the moment?\nLN: It's a bit of both. I mean, you can't not think of it. But anyway, it's a long race to the very end. You know, we've seen many times anything in Formula 1 can happen, and I just kept pushing until the last two or three laps, [then] I could ease it off a bit, but I was still wanting to fight to the end and that's what we did. That's what we had to do this season, you know, with Max chasing us the whole way, with Oscar catching up again at the end. They certainly didn't make my life easy this year. But yeah, I don't know. I'm happy.\nQ: Understandably so. And, you know, this is a beautiful moment of winning your first world championship. I don't know if you were aware of a moment — we were — you were under investigation with the overtake on Tsunoda where you went beyond the white lines, and of course nothing came of that. But were you aware of it? Did your team tell you? Because we were all on the edge of our seats.\nLN: I had no idea. I had no idea. I didn't care. I mean, I knew what I did was fine so I had nothing to worry about. Yeah. I was just trying to enjoy the moment. You know, there's not many people in the world, not many people in Formula 1 ever get to experience what I've experienced this season and this year. So, I'm happy for everyone. I'm happy for everyone more than me, but yeah, I'm just crazy happy.\nQ: That's wonderful to see. We're looking across, we see Zak Brown, we see your parents, your brother, your family, everyone here who's been on this journey with you. So just once again, are you able to compartmentalise — you are the world champion?\nLN: I mean, look, it's been a long journey with me and McLaren. I've been with them for like nine years and we've been through plenty of crazy difficult times and plenty of good times, you know. So, for me to feel like I can bring something back to them — it's their first Drivers' in many, many years — so I feel like I did my part for the team this year and I'm very proud of myself for that, but I'm even more proud for everyone that I've hopefully made cry.\nPRESS CONFERENCE\nQ: Max, look, very well done. What a race. What a season. How do you reflect on the race and the weekend as a whole? Let's start with that.\nMax VERSTAPPEN: Well, honestly, we maximised everything that we could. We put it on pole, and we won the race. And I think also in the race, we had very strong pace. So, there’s really not much that I could have done different. I think what complicated it a bit was that Oscar was on a different strategy. So, you never know, of course, when he then pits, how much pace he has in hand to catch up again. That also complicates a bit trying to keep the pack together or whatever. But, yeah, overall, just very proud again of the weekend that we had. We put it all out there, and, yeah, the car was actually enjoyable to drive.\nQ: And what about the season as a whole? I mean, think back to Hungary where you finished more than a minute behind the winner, and here you are within two points of the world champion.\nMV: Yeah. Massive rollercoaster for us. Of course, the first half had some nice moments, but mainly tough moments — some really tough races and feelings. But I’m also very proud of how we never gave up. And, again, that’s also a lesson for the future, for everyone, that even when it looks like you’re out of it, you never give up. You keep working hard to try and understand your issues, and then you never know what can happen.\nQ: Final one. A few words from you on our new world champion, Lando Norris.\nMV: Winning your first title is something that I think we all dreamt of when you get into the sport. You work for that since you're a little kid. It’s what you dream of. So, when you win your first title, this is very emotional. And, yeah, I hope for Lando as well. You know, I saw a lot of his family is here, so it’s important to enjoy this a lot as well tonight. Also, with his team. I think, again, that’s another story where it showed that even when you have tough years, when you keep working hard, you keep adding good people to the team, you can overcome all of those things, and you can become very successful again. And, yeah, they had an incredible season together, so it’s important that they enjoy it.\nQ: Oscar, many congratulations on your 16th podium of 2025. You raced hard and fast this evening. How do you reflect on the race and the weekend?\nOscar PIASTRI: I think, honestly, pretty good. There wasn’t anything left out there. Obviously, we tried a bit of a gamble on the strategy to give ourselves some different options and hope that the stars aligned to give ourselves the best chance. But ultimately, in the end, that didn’t happen. So, yeah, I think given as well I missed a practice session, it took a little bit to find my feet. I think that was the maximum we could have achieved today. We didn’t have an answer for Max’s pace. So pretty happy with the weekend. Not much more we could have done.\nQ: And the season as a whole, how do you reflect on that? You led the title longer than any other driver this year.\nOP: Yeah. I mean, I think, obviously, I would have wished for a slightly different ending, but I think this year I’ve learned a hell of a lot about myself as a race car driver, myself as a person. I think if you had presented this season at the start of the year with the pole positions and the wins and the podiums, I definitely would have been pretty happy with that. And I think even in the tough moments, I’ve learned a lot about myself and how I can be stronger in the future. So, I think, ultimately, there’s a little bit of disappointment, obviously, but I think I can be very proud of the season I’ve had and plenty of lessons to take to the future.\nQ: And can we get your thoughts on Lando and the job he’s done this year to be world champion?\nOP: I think a very deserving winner. I know that every weekend I go on track, it’s going to be tough. And I think we’ve pushed each other through the last three years. I think especially this season has been tighter than ever. So, yeah, I think he’s had a great season. Probably all three of us, but obviously, myself and Lando in the same team, in the same car, have had our ups and downs at different moments. Ultimately, I think he’s had a good season and a deserving champion.\nQUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR\nQ: (Scott Mitchell-Malm – The Race). Max, you hinted a little bit at the complication with Oscar’s strategy and how you ran your race. Did you give much thought pre-race or during the race about backing up or trying to impact the flow of the race that way? Or was it more just focus on getting the job done out front?\nMV: I had a lot of scenarios in my head, but then, of course, I knew once the tyres Oscar had on the car, that would be quite difficult. I think we were probably a bit too quick up front. The others couldn’t really follow that well. I think Charles drove his heart out today to try and get onto that podium, so that was also impressive to see. But, of course, they went for a two-stop. I think even that made it more complicated because if you stay on a one-stop, backing the whole thing up is tough. And I think this new layout around here makes it even harder to do that compared to 2016 or whatever.\nQ: (Ben Waterworth – Speedcafe) Oscar, you obviously touched on the disappointment of the season and ultimately not achieving what you were hoping. But do you think, in reflection, you’ll look back at this year as a success? Not to take away from the careers of your other two rivals but neither of them was fighting for a world championship in their third season. You’ve come away with the most ever wins by an Australian in a single season. Can you take that hunger for the title into next year?\nOP: Definitely. I mean, comparing different parts of different people’s careers is always difficult with different cars and stuff. But I think definitely I can be very proud of the season I’ve had. When I look at this season compared to my first two years in F1, this year has been head and shoulders above the first two. Ultimately, whilst the end result is not quite what I wanted, there’s a lot of optimism and a lot of strength that I’ve gained from proving to myself what I can achieve through this season. Those are the kinds of things that are not necessarily tied to results. So I think for me, I can definitely take that forward into the future. It’s only my third attempt at this in F1. Hopefully, I’ve got plenty more to go, but there are definitely lessons from this year that will only make me stronger.\nQ: (Tim Hauraney – TSN) Max, congratulations on the race win. We heard you on the radio to GP. What has he meant to you over your career, in particular this season with all the ups and downs?\nMV: It’s been an emotional year. Forget about the results this year. I also don’t want to go too much into detail, but it’s been tough. But I’m very happy to be able to work with someone that passionate. Of course, he is my race engineer, but I see him as my friend. We have lived through so many emotional things together and fantastic achievements. I’m sure he was a bit emotional after the flag. So, I’m really looking forward to leaving here and catching up with him because it’s not been easy at times for him. I’m just very proud to be able to work with someone that good. A proper example of someone that never gave up this season, even through the difficult times.\nQ: (Ronald Vording – Motorsport.com) Oscar, you mentioned a couple of times that you’ve learned a lot of lessons this year. What have been the most valuable lessons? Is that related to Austin, Mexico, or does it go further?\nOP: Ultimately both, I think. There’ve definitely been lessons directly to do with how I drive the car, how I can be better in different conditions, and just become a better all-round driver. There have also been lessons outside the car — dealing with adversity, dealing with difficult moments. I’ve learned a lot about myself in those kinds of things. So, there have been lessons both in and out of the car that will definitely help me for the future.\nQ: (Julian Linden – Herald Sun) Oscar, 91 days till Melbourne. I’m sure you’re not thinking about it now. What will you do over the summer break to prepare for it? How will you rest and recuperate?\nOP: Yeah, it’s nice having another summer break. I’m going back to Australia for a little bit, see my family and friends, give my annual hellos and goodbyes. I’m looking forward to some time away from racing, to be honest. It’s been a long, demanding season. As enjoyable as driving the fastest cars in the world is, a break now and again is always a nice thing. So, I’m just looking forward to not thinking about race cars and spending time with people around me. Then obviously, the new season is not far away, so it’s going to be important to enjoy that time off and then come back refreshed with the new challenges for next year.\nQ: (Mat Coch – PlanetF1.com) Max, result and championship outcome aside, is this the best that you feel you've ever driven in Formula 1?\nMV: Yeah, I think so. I mean, I have no regrets about my season. I think the performance has been strong. I've hated this car at times, but I've also loved it at times. And I always tried to extract the most from it, even in the difficult weekends that we’ve had. But, yeah, it's been, like I said before, a proper rollercoaster with the car. Luckily, the last, I would say, eight, nine rounds in general have been a lot more enjoyable. And also, in the team, we have a great atmosphere at the moment. We’re really on a roll — positive energy, belief, confidence — and that’s exactly what you want heading into next year.\nQ: (Vincent Sondermeijer - NRC Netherlands) Max, was there a point during the race where you sort of resigned and thought, “Okay, I’m not going to win the title,” or did you keep believing that there might be something happening until the final lap?\nMV: I just kept looking on the screen to see if something would pop up. Yeah, I mean, the race itself went really well, and I was just enjoying sitting in the car and driving it. And every straight you keep looking if something happens, but at the same time, that's part of racing. So I was not really too fussed about it.\nQ: (Tom Cary – The Telegraph) Oscar, you mentioned taking some time. Are you going to get to any of the cricket this winter? Don’t know if you were aware of the result earlier today in the Ashes...\nOP: Oh yes, I am.\nQ: (Tom Cary – The Telegraph) Did you think maybe luck was on your side — Australia gave England an absolute walloping there — and in time for the race as well?\nOP: Yeah, it was nice that the boys could wrap it up before the race started. Hopefully, I will get to some cricket — ideally Boxing Day, given it’s in Melbourne. I mean, there’s part of me that kind of wants the series to still be alive by that point, and part of me that really doesn’t. So I’ll take whatever we can get. It’s been enjoyable to watch for the last couple of weeks.\nQ: (Tom Cary - The Telegraph) Oscar, you’ve been in quite a few championship battles since your career began. Is fighting for an F1 title anything comparable to other championship fights you’ve had?\nOP: I think there are similarities, yes. The emotions you feel are more or less the same. I think what’s different in F1, when I compare it to the junior championships, is the length. The longest junior championship I had was ten rounds. This one has been two and a half times that. The duration you have to live through is much more. My F2 season, for example, was eight rounds., So I think that part is quite different. And I think just the stakes are a little bit different as well. In the junior categories, you obviously want to win the championship, but you’re trying to make your case for why you should be in F1. I think we’ve seen through the years — Max is probably the perfect example — you don’t need to win championships to demonstrate your capabilities for F1. Whereas when you get to F1, there’s nothing more than becoming champion. So that aspect is a bit different, but, yeah, there are also some similarities.\n1 / 5\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Race winner Max Verstappen of the Netherlands driving the (1) Oracle Red Bull Racing RB21 arrives in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Bryn Lennon - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\nQ: (Leonid Kliuev – Grande Premio Brazil) Oscar, how do you think the dynamics will change next year in the team between yourself and Lando? Will it be harder to fight with him now that he’s a reigning world champion?\nOP: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think that will change anything. For me, he’s obviously had a great season this year and a deserving champion, but he’s still Lando Norris. It’s not like he’s become Superman. So, I don’t think things will change with that. I’m expecting full fairness from the team and equality going forward. I don’t have any concerns that that will change at all. Clearly, Lando’s had a very strong season this year, and ultimately did a better job.\nQ: (Jack Smith (Motorsport Monday / MotorsportWeek.com) Max, to follow up on Matt’s question. Given how well you did drive this year and how much ground you made up to take it all the way to this race, can you take as much pride from this season compared to the pride you took from the last four years when you did win the championship?\nMV: I mean, at the end of the day, of course, it’s always nicer to win it. But, honestly, I’m sitting here now with probably a better feeling than what I had last year at this time because the second half of last year was pretty tricky at times as well. So, we have been struggling for, I would say, a year — the second half of last year and the first half of this year. But I actually feel a lot better now. Of course, shame to miss out on the title, but at the same time, for a long period of time I was not even thinking about the title. I never felt like I was in it until a few rounds ago. That’s pretty crazy. But, yeah, you take your pride in different ways. I’m happy with myself and going into next year I’m not in a state of having to worry about my skills or whatever. So, yeah, I feel good.\nQ: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Oscar, just picking up on your point about fairness. McLaren’s got quite a bit of flack at points this year for the papaya rules and the equality between you and Lando. But we’ve got through this season without any major bust-ups and the team achieved the ultimate goal of a McLaren driver winning the title. How much is that testament to the team’s approach and culture?\nOP: I think it is a testament to the way we go racing. Obviously, it’s not easy fighting for both the Constructors’ Championship and the Drivers’ Championship with two very evenly matched drivers. But ultimately, that’s a problem we knew we were going to have. At the end of the day, I think there’s a lot of good things that come from that. Yes, there’s difficult moments and tension at times, but I think both Lando and I have become better drivers from pushing each other to the limit. Sometimes that’s been uncomfortable for everyone, but ultimately, yeah, it’s been a good thing. We’ve had a lot of discussions through the year, and I’m sure we’ll have discussions in the off-season about anything we want to do slightly differently for next year. But I think at the end of the day, they gave us both as good a chance as the team could have to fairly fight for a world championship, and that’s all you can ask for.\nQ: (Giles Richards – The Guardian) Max, you lost out to Lando by just two points. What do you think now about the incident with George Russell in Spain? Do you regret that looking back in hindsight?\nMV: You forget all the other stuff that happened in my season. The only thing you mention is Barcelona. I knew that would come. You’re giving me a stupid grin now. I don’t know. Yeah, it’s part of racing at the end. You live and learn. The championship is one of 24 rounds. I’ve also had a lot of early Christmas presents given to me in the second half, so you can also question that.\nCHAMPION’S PRESS CONFERENCE\nQ: A very warm welcome to the FIA Formula One World Champion Lando Norris. Can you begin to describe how this feels for us?\nLN: I just laugh. It's tough to describe. It's tough to put in words. I mean, I just want to go and spend some time with my team, my engineers, my mom and my dad. I don't know what I'm going to say. So much goes into achieving what we've achieved today. You know, from all those years ago when I saw Formula 1 on the TV, when I saw a go-kart for the first time – my memories the last couple laps were really just that. They took me back to where it all started because I wouldn't be here without my parents and the sacrifice they've done. My brother and my sisters, the amount of times they text me and I don't get back to them. You know, just everything. Everything that leads into achieving what we all achieved today. And this is not my world championship. This is ours. This is one where I get to say, \"Thank you, mom,\" and \"Thank you, dad.\" They're the ones who sacrificed so much to let me be the lucky boy that I am today – to live my dream, to do what I have loved doing since I was a kid, driving that go-kart for the first time at home. The best memories ever, you know. And so much goes into it every year. And for the first time, I really get to say thank you to them, to my parents, to my family. And I get to really make them feel like everything they did was worth it. They might have felt like it was worth it after getting to Formula 1 or getting the first win in Miami. But, you know, the thing that makes me smile every day is making my parents proud, making my friends proud, the people who support me so much through the plenty of tough times I've had this year, celebrate the good times that I've had this year. But I feel like I finally get something to say thank you – not just in words, but in terms of the volume of a championship – that they are just as much a part of as I feel like I go out on track and perform. They're with me through every step of the way. And today, I just get to say thank you to all of them. I get to make them smile. And that’s all I really want in my life is all of them to be happy and to get to celebrate. And that’s what I managed to do for them all today.\nQ: Lando, you were pretty convincing earlier in the weekend when you said you felt relaxed. Was that the reality? Just how tough has this weekend been for you emotionally?\nLN: I've had a lot of tough moments in the beginning of the season. I had great moments – winning the first race in Australia certainly gave me a big boost. But quite quickly, I had not the best run of results, and Oscar did an incredible job, was consistently ahead of me. It got tricky at times. I think at the end of the day, it shows that consistency over a year is what helps achieve what we've achieved today. But those tricky moments, like everyone says, you’ve got to learn from them, acknowledge them, understand them. I've had to go above and beyond in terms of expanding my group, the people I work with on the track, and more so off the track. The amount of people that I have in my corner – not from McLaren but externally: my friends, my family, my coaches, people that help me think in better ways and perform in better ways. So many people allowed me to go out and be more calm and almost try and not acknowledge the pressure or just perform under pressure and have the second half of the season that I had. If I look back on it, my first half of the season – not the most impressive. Certainly, times I made some mistakes, made some bad judgments. I made my errors, as I'm sure every driver would admit to. But how I managed to turn all of that and have the second half of the season that I had is what makes me very proud – that I've been able to prove myself wrong.\nThere were doubts I had in the beginning of the year, and I proved myself wrong. And that's something that makes me very happy. Like I said, this was a moment that I got to thank them all for that – all their hard work, all the stuff that other people do for me. This is my way of saying thank you. But I did feel calm. I felt calm until three corners to go. I started to shake a little bit. I got to think of all those incredible memories very quickly, and then I got to see the team when I went over the line. And this is a moment that I'll never forget.\nQ: Final one from me. Just how do you think you're going to grow as a driver as a result of this championship?\nLN: That I'll find out. You know, I feel proud but not because I'm gonna wake up tomorrow and go, \"I beat everyone.\" I'm not proud because I get to just say I'm a world champion. I'm proud because I feel like I made a lot of other people happy. I made my engineer Will, Jarv as well – they don’t get to see their family much. They've seen me grow up more than they've seen their own kids grow up. I feel bad about that. But the fact that they put so much effort into making me perform and helping us... I'm shaking. Helping us all perform. The fact I get to make them feel like their time has been, hopefully, a little bit worth it—that's what makes me so happy. I hope it doesn’t change anything I do, the way I think, the way I do things. I believe I won the championship this year my way – by being a fair driver, by trying to be an honest driver. At times, could I have been more aggressive and got off the brakes and had a few people over? I certainly could have done, and maybe I would need to do more of that in the future. But did I need to do it this year? Is that the way I want to go racing? Is that me? It's not. And I'm sure if you compare me, if that’s what you wanna do, to all the champions: have I been as aggressive as them at times? No. Have I been as daring as them at times? No. But did I do just what I needed to do to win the world championship? Did I perform consistently? Did I perform when I needed to under the most pressure? Post-Zandvoort, did I come back in the way I had to? Did I have three, four weekends of great results? I did. And I performed when I needed to perform to win the World Championship this season. And in the end, that’s what I needed to do. That’s all I needed to do. Of course, I’ll learn from everything. Like I said, moments I wish I could go back on and I feel bad for, like Montreal and things like that, I embarrassed myself. But I wish I could go back and change some things. Plenty of moments to learn from. I feel like I'm a better driver now, certainly, than I was at the beginning of the season. But everyone’s going to do it. And when I’m racing against Max, a four-time world champion, when I’m racing against Oscar, a guy who at some point in the future will probably beat me and be a world champion, I’m performing. And I’m having to perform against the best in the world. And I look forward to plenty more times like that. And I need to understand what I can do better, how can I do better, how can I perform more consistently against them and learn from them? And I feel like I did that this year, and I've got to do that even more next year if I want to retain what we've been able to achieve this year.\nQUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR\nQ: (Laurence Edmondson – ESPN) Congratulations, Lando. Well done. Fantastic. Just on the Zandvoort thing you mentioned there. Obviously, there you were 34 points behind all of a sudden. Did that actually release some of the pressure and allow you to get more of your true performance from yourself for that period afterwards?\nLN: I honestly would just want to say no. It didn’t allow me to relax. Like, when I see 34 points against a guy who's in the same car, who's doing an incredible job, who I know is incredibly quick, that didn’t fill me with confidence. And it wasn’t like, \"I got nothing to lose now, I can just go.\" I felt like I was trying to do everything I could before, and I continued to try and do everything I could after. But I just had to step up what I was doing away from the track. Like I said before, the people I was working with, I added more people to that group. I had to work harder both on the simulator and here at track. I had to change my approaches. I had to change my... yeah, like a lot of people do. I had to dig deep and try and understand more things quicker and in a more advanced way than I ever have before. That’s what gave me the advantage I had – not, \"Oh, the pressure’s off, I can go and do what I’d like to do.\" It was really the opposite. I was like, \"Oh, shoot. I’m quite a long way behind against a pretty freaking fast driver, and I’ve got to step it up.\" And I got to be more myself because of external factors—working with more professionals in different areas to unlock more of my ability. And I think when you saw that, I had that run of great results, which is ultimately what got me the championship in the end.\nQ: (Phil Duncan – PA) Congrats, Lando, on getting the job done. You've often described Max this year as, you know, the best that there's ever been, you know, almost the GOAT. What does it feel to you to be able to have actually beaten him to win the first world title? And now you've got that one out of the way, do you think more world championships can follow?\nLN: Look. I hate ever having to try and compare myself to other people. This is all for you guys to decide whether someone’s better than someone else or not. All I try and do every weekend is the best of what I can. But then you decide he’s better than him, or he’s got a worse car and he’s doing better – write what you like, decide what you like. I certainly feel like at moments I've driven better than I feel like other people can. And I feel like I drove at a level I don't think other people can match. But have I also made my mistakes? Have I made more mistakes than other people at times? Yes. Is there stuff Max could do better at times than me? Yes. Do I believe he's unbeatable? No. But you also don’t know, do you? It’s hard to know. Like, they also struggled with the car in the mid part of the season. They’ve had an incredible second half of the season. They took advantage of the fact we had two of us fighting for a world championship. He really made the most of that and Max drove like he is a four-time world champion. And I’m very happy that I got to race against him and try to prove myself against him. Whether then you want to write whatever you want to write, against him, against me, or whatever it is, feel free. But I’m not here—honestly, like I said at the beginning—my motivation is not here to prove I’m better than someone else. That’s not what makes me happy. I’m not goping to wake up tomorrow and go, \"I’m so happy because I beat Max.\" I honestly, deep down, don’t care about that. I don’t care if every article is, \"Do you think he’s better than me?\" or \"Oscar’s better,\" or whatever it is. Doesn’t matter. I have no interest in that. I’ve just done what I’ve needed to do to win the world championship. That’s it. And I made my people happy. That’s all I really care about at the end of the day. I’m not going to wake up happy tomorrow because I can just go and say to myself, \"I’m world champion.\" It might make me smile, but it’s not gonna be the truth. It’s gonna be, \"My mom’s happy. My dad’s happy. My sisters are happy. My brother’s happy. My friends are happy.\" And that’s all I need in my life.\nQ: (Scott Mitchell-Malm – The Race) Congratulations, Lando. You mentioned the difficulties in the first part of the year. Just wondered around sort of the first third of the season—did you start to feel like the chance was slipping away at all? And at what point did you start to change things around you? You mentioned additions and who you worked with and whatnot. Did that come later, or were you starting to do things already earlier in the season?\nLN: Honestly, I can’t remember the exact time things started. Certainly levelled up a lot more through the halfway point – around Zandvoort time – but it definitely started prior to that.\nIt started after I had that kind of bad run in race two, three, four, five, six, that kind of area. Or certainly when it was like, \"Alright, my way is not working. I’ve got to understand things differently. I’ve got to speak to more people. I've got to understand what I'm thinking, why I’m thinking it. Why am I doing this? Why am I getting tense in qualifying? Why am I making the decisions that I’m making?\" Whatever it may be. Certainly, the bad run of results and lack of performance—not speed, because I think the speed’s always there—but lack of putting things together when I had the capability of putting things together, allowed or opened up the doors to go and understand: \"Okay, I need to do more than just try again next weekend. I need to try and understand things on a deeper level.\" Mentally. That opened up understanding myself more, understanding things more at a championship level. That’s the level I’ve got to be at.  They are world champions. And yes, certainly the struggles turned into strength. So I would say, if I didn’t have those struggles at the beginning and then had the weakness at the end, would I have caught on to those things as quickly? Probably not. So I was thankful that I had some of the tough moments early on and managed to turn them around. When I got in that kind of good rhythm in the last three months, almost when there’s been more pressure than ever, was almost when I felt most comfortable and most confident into qualifying, you know, I could go from chatting to my engineers and having a fun time with my mechanics to going out and getting pole a few minutes later. So, yeah, the struggle was at the beginning really allowed me to unlock my potential later on.\nQ: (Molly Hudson – The Times) Huge congratulations, Lando. How proud are you not just of in the car, but outside of the car you’ve stayed the same Lando, you’ve still been critical on yourself, you’ve still worn your heart on your sleeve. There’s been a lot of people that have written or said, \"you can’t win a championship like that,\" and you have.\nLN: Thank you. End of. Look, again, that’s one of the things that makes me most proud. I feel like I have just managed to win it the way I wanted to win it, which was not by being someone I’m not. Not trying to be as aggressive as Max or as forceful as other champions might have been in the past – whatever it may be. I’m happy. I just won it my way. I’m happy I could go out and be myself and win it Lando’s way, as Andrea would tell me. That certainly makes me happy. Like I said at the beginning, could I have gone out and been more of that person you probably want me to be at times? I could have done. I would have been less proud about it in some ways. So, that’s why I’m very happy with myself. I kept my cool, I kept to myself, I kept the focus on myself, and I got the most out of how I am. And I know at times I say some stupid things, and I say some things about Max, or I might have said some things at times in the past that everyone talks about, about Lewis. Some things I regret and I wish I could take back and never have come out my mouth. But I honestly believe I give more respect to anyone else than anyone else. I give more respect to Oscar. I give more respect to Max. I try and give as much respect as I can to Lewis—he’s seven-time world champion. He’s the best driver—you compare him to Schumacher—the best driver that’s ever been in Formula 1. I’m not even close to that. I might never be. I dream of those kind of things. I dreamed of today, and I’ve managed to achieve one of seven, comparing to him. And do I regret some of the comments I might have said in cooldown rooms or whatever it is? Yes. But a lot of those are in the heat of the moment. And by the time I’ve said it, I’ve gone, \"Why the hell did I just say that?\" So, I try and be as genuine as I can. I try and always speak the truth. I never try and give you guys false understandings of things. If I think we’re going to win, I’m going say, \"I think we’re gonna win.\" If I think Red Bull are going be fast or probably going to be fast, I’m going to say it. I’m trying to honestly always—I have no gain by trying to hide things from you guys. And, you know, deep down, do I really hate when you write crap about me? I do. It’s also life, and I’ve learned to live with some of those things more. And I also value that everyone has their own opinions—whether they like me or not or think someone else is better or not—like we just spoke about. What I’m happy is that I did things my way this season. I won it in my way, my style of just trying to be a good person and a good team member. And I’m proud about that. No matter what other people want to write about and say about it, no one really knows the truth apart from the people on the inside, in terms of what’s going on.\nAnd I don’t need to listen to those things. So, as long as I know I’ve done a good job, which I have now proven to myself I have, then that’s the only thing I really need to listen to. Is now myself and my team. And that’s all I need.\nQ: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Lando, massive congratulations. In the race itself, how stressful were those moments? Obviously, quite a few, bits of traffic, you had to fight your way through and things like that. What’s your plan to celebrate tonight? Is it just Monster in that glass or anything stronger?\nLN: Hell no! It’s way more! This might be my only time—I really hope it’s not, and I am confident it’s not going be my only time of sitting here alone. It’s quite lonely here. No one else sat by my side.\nBut I want to enjoy this moment because not many people ever will get to experience what I’ve managed to experience today. The effect, the feeling it’s had on other people, that makes me so happy. So I’m going to celebrate. Well. My friends, I really hope they’ve all had many drinks already because I want to go and party with them, because this is more about them than it is about me.\nMy mechanics, my engineers, I mean, crap, we got a test on Tuesday morning, but yeah. I know certainly moments through the race today where I was like, \"Okay, Tsunoda’s up next.\" And we knew from before that Tsunoda might try and do it—try and hold me up and make my life difficult like Perez did to Lewis just a few seasons ago. So a lot of that was in our script and estimations already. But I managed to get through pretty quickly. And it was a bit close. It got pretty close. And it’s crazy thinking about it, because they do think about it straight away. You're like, \"Damn, if that was five centimetres closer—it’s over.\" And that’s when you get to the end of the race—three laps to go, four laps to go—I stopped taking any kerbs because I’m like, if that just makes one piece of the car undo itself, it’s over. That kind of thing. So, I’m like, \"Should I go for fastest lap on the last lap? Maybe.\" It’s not worth it. A lot of those things go through your head. I had to make some fairly decisive overtakes and commit to a few things. But again, the championship was not won today. It was won by my consistency this year, by my great races over the last four months or so. It could have been an easier race. It also could have been a harder race. But sometimes, yeah—it was just another race on the calendar for me. It was a fun race, but I tried to really treat it as, \"Okay, it’s just another race today,\" like I said, and tried to stay calm through it, which I feel like I did, and tried to just maximise my result."}

Max Verstappen (Red Bull), 2. Oscar Piastri (McLaren), 3. Carlos Sainz (Williams)\nTRACK INTERVIEWS\n(Conducted by Martin Brundle)\nQ: Max, unbelievable. Congratulations. You've been the reigning world champion since Abu Dhabi 2021. And you still are. You're still in the game for this year's world championship.\nMax VERSTAPPEN: Yeah. This was an incredible race for us. We made the right call there as a team to box under that Safety Car, and yeah, that was smart. And of course, super happy to win here. We stay, of course, in the fight ‘til the end.\nQ: But your pace was great as well. You could keep the McLarens in sight all the time.\nMV: Yeah, I think of course it was a little bit offset because of it all, but for us I think it was a very strong race on a weekend where I think it was a little bit tough. But yeah, we still won the race and that was the most important.\nQ: When McLaren didn’t pit, did you think, I’ve got this, I can do this?\nMV: Yeah, I was like, ‘that’s an interesting move’. I knew that then, of course, we had a bit of a gap but still you need to keep the tyres alive for 25 laps as well. The wear is very high around here, but luckily it all worked out.\nQ: Thank you. Oscar, P2, you gave it your best. You closed to within eight seconds. You had to make that extra pit stop up, but it wasn’t quite enough on the night.\nOscar PIASTRI: Yeah. You know, clearly, we didn’t get it right tonight. I drove the best race that I could, as fast as I could, and yeah, there was nothing left out there. So tried my best, but it wasn’t to be tonight unfortunately.\nQ: Do you think the team maybe should have split the strategy, or obviously now in hindsight you’d like to have come in on that Safety Car?\nOP: I think in hindsight it’s pretty obvious what we would have done, but I’m sure we’ll discuss it as a team.\nQ: But once again, you’re still very much in the championship hunt.\nOP: Yep. Yeah, I mean it’s not all bad, obviously. It’s been a really good weekend. The pace has been very strong, but yeah, obviously a little bit tough to swallow at the moment.\nQ: So, Carlos, I am so happy for you. So happy for your team. What a brilliant drive. Once again, onto the podium for Williams. Congratulations.\nCarlos SAINZ: Thank you, thank you. Yeah, I’m so happy. So proud of the whole team for what we’ve done today because we came into this weekend thinking it was going to be the most difficult weekend of the year and suddenly, we came out with a podium out of it. We nailed the race pace. I was super quick, much quicker than expected. We nailed the strategy. We nailed the tyre management, nailed the start, nailed all the defending and management, and that brought us an unexpected podium. So, I cannot be more proud.\nQ: And the team delivered you a great pit stop and somehow fed you back into the pit lane.\nCS: That’s why we got everything right today. You know, we had a tough first half of the season where things didn’t come together, but we improved in so many areas during the year. And today, there were a few opportunities out there to grab, and we grabbed all of them by executing a perfect race. And yeah, honestly, I’m over the moon with this podium because I absolutely didn’t expect it.\nQ: Well done again. Max, final word. Can you do this? Can you still take this world championship?\nMV: Well, it’s all possible now. We’ll see. I don’t really worry about it too much.\nQ: Not too long to wait now.\nMV: Exactly. Next weekend.\nPRESS CONFERENCE\nQ: Max, a brilliant win by you. Very well done. After starting P3, just tell us how this race ended up coming to you.\nMax VERSTAPPEN: Yeah. I mean, the start was decent. So, I got one spot, and then from there, I was, of course, just looking after the tyres a bit. But then, yeah, of course, the Safety Car came out basically at the right lap. So, we opted to box, and I guess a lot of people behind me had the same idea. So, yeah, the team did a very good job there. Stayed out of trouble also with the pit lane. You know, it was quite a busy pit lane. And from there onwards, I knew that we probably did the right thing. I think I also knew that the two McLarens needed a lot of pace to overcome basically that kind of pit stop. So I think when the Safety Car went away, of course, initially they pulled away quite a bit. But for me, it was just making sure that these two stint lengths were in the best possible pace from the first step until the end. And I think we managed that well. Just trying to do my own pace and look after the tyres, and it was enough until the flag.\nQ: That Safety Car, just how surprised were you when you saw the McLarens stay out?\nMV: Well, I mean, first of all, when they called me in, I had to look and remember that it was lap—like, we were going into lap seven. So I was like, okay, now we can go to the end. So then, yeah, I was a bit surprised once I did the whole pit stop because, I mean, when they call you in, you focus on the box and making sure you're not in trouble with releasing and whatever. So when I came out of the pit, I was like, okay, I think this is a very good opportunity now for us to win the race.\nQ: Was staying out even discussed over the radio?\nMV: I don't know. I didn’t hear anything. So maybe they were talking on the pit wall. But to me, it was very clear. I just got the call to box.\nQ: Did you think at that moment this race was yours to lose?\nMV: I thought at that moment that there was a big chance of winning it, yeah. I don’t think about losing. That’s not in my head. I think about how to win.\nQ: Look, Max, the car looked really strong today. Can you just tell us in what areas it was better in the race than it had been earlier in the weekend?\nMV: I mean, it was still the same as in qualifying. I'm struggling with the same things, but we won the race today by the strategy. And then, from there onwards, just trying to manage your issues in the best possible way, and I think we did that very well.\nQ: Let’s throw it forward a week. Just how hopeful are you about the car's potential in Abu Dhabi next week?\nMV: I have no idea. I mean, again, I hope that we start the weekend well. Let’s say like that. That would help a lot. I think on pure pace, it will be tough, but a race like today also shows that it's not always straightforward, a Grand Prix, and a lot of things can happen. So I’m probably relying a little bit on that.\nQ: You're 12 points behind Lando Norris. Given the season you've had, how much are you relishing this opportunity?\nMV: I'm excited. I mean, I'm happy to go there and have a go at it. But like I said before, you need to also be realistic, that I think on pure pace, we’re not at the same level. But at the same time, when strategy maybe comes into play or making the right calls at the right time, we might have the opportunity.\nQ: Alright. Very well done today. Thank you for that, Max. Oscar, if we could come to you now. ‘Speechless – I don't have any words,’ that’s you said over the radio on the slowdown lap. Can you describe your level of frustration after this P2?\nOscar PIASTRI: Pretty high – and that’s saying quite a lot given the last few races I’ve had. But, yeah, I mean, clearly, we didn’t get it right today, which is a shame because the whole weekend went very, very well. We had a lot of pace. I felt like I drove well. So, yeah, it’s pretty painful.\nQ: Which hurts more: the disqualification last weekend or the loss of a win here in Qatar?\nOP: I mean, I think on a personal level, I feel like I’ve lost a win today. You know, in Vegas, I lost a P4. Obviously, for the team, it was a pretty painful weekend. But, yeah, I think for me personally, this probably hurts more.\nQ: Can we delve into the Safety Car decision to stay out a little bit? Did you ask to pit yourself, and how surprised were you when you were aware that everyone behind you was pitting?\nOP: I asked, what are we doing? Because we were getting pretty close to the pit entry and I hadn’t had a call yet. So, you know, I think when you don’t get a call instantly when the Safety Car comes out, clearly there’s probably some discussions going on about what to do. And in that situation, you have to trust the team because they have a lot more information than the driver in the car on where gaps are and stuff like that. So, yeah, I mean, in that scenario I have to trust what the team decide.\nQ: Let's look at the positives. You were on pole, you won the Sprint, and you were brilliantly fast all weekend. Just how much of a consolation is all that?\nOP: I think in the next few days, probably, yes, that will be quite an encouraging thing. I think this weekend is probably one of my best of the season. There are one or two others that I can think of being on the same level as this weekend. So, from that side of things, I'm very, very happy and very pleased to just be back in terms of pace. But unfortunately, it’s another weekend where something's just not gone our way.\n1 / 5\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 30: Race winner Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates on arrival in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 30, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar. (Photo by Mark Thompson/Getty Images)\nQ: Alright. Oscar, thank you very much for that. Carlos, let's come to you. Brilliant performance by you. Now, you came into Qatar saying that you were probably going to have the most difficult weekend of the season, yet here you are in P3. Can you just explain what's happened?\nCarlos SAINZ: Yeah, I don't know. I think it's obviously partly due to—or mainly due to—the hard work I think everyone's done trying to prepare this race after the very difficult weekend we had in Budapest, which is kind of, sort of, this long, medium-speed combined corners that we always seem to be very, very weak. We put together a plan with the team to try some different things in the simulator and in the factory to try and switch on the car for these kinds of track. And to be honest, right from the get-go in practice, the car was a lot better than expected, a lot more competitive.\nAnd then we did another couple of changes going into the main quali and the main race after our learnings from the Sprint that really switched on the car, especially in the race pace. Yesterday, we struggled a lot with front deg. Today, the car felt a lot better, and we went from seeing Antonelli checking out in the Sprint and giving us ten seconds, to all of a sudden, today having a chance to keep him behind, race him, and even, obviously, with the strategy thing of the McLarens also keep Lando behind.\nQ: Compared to Hungary, just how different was the set-up on the car here in Qatar?\nCS: Very different. Very, very different. I had a few ideas for the team to try and simulate, or the team came up with some other ideas and together we put together, I think, a car that honestly since the first lap was a lot better than what we thought. Already in the simulator it felt OK, but you never really trust the simulator fully. You say, no, it cannot be this good. And suddenly from the first lap of FP1, I think I was trading P1s, P2s, and P3s with these guys, and I was like, yeah, this might be working. And then we did some good progress through the weekend. Then we executed a really good race, with a good start from P7 to P5, great pit stops, great strategy, great management of the gaps, and the tyre management that we have to do with cars that are a bit quicker than us around us, you know, they’re forcing us to push on that front left tyre, which here is never easy. We managed that really well, and that brought us the P3.\nQ: If only you'd made these set-up changes earlier in the year…\nCS: But it’s not possible because in order to make them, you need to know the car, and you need to try multiple things—trial and error. You need to get it wrong many weekends to know that this doesn't work, to then try the other direction that might work. And the other direction sometimes doesn't work either. And you need to try a completely different thing and you make another mistake. So, I always say the same thing: it takes time. When you switch teams, it really, really takes time – and races. There is no testing. So, you need to try things on a race weekend and you need your first 10-15 races to understand these kinds of things—your simulator sessions to try things. And you need the team to be brave. You need also people to be bold and come up with ideas. And in the end, it always pays off. There are no secrets in this sport. I think hard work and good understanding, good conclusions always pay off. And to be honest, the second half of the year, we are performing at a very high level.\nQ: Given everything you've just said, does this P3 feel sweeter than Baku?\nCS: It feels different. Baku was a bit of a relief because I’d had such a difficult 10 races. I was very quick in the first few races, but always things happening to me. No results coming my way. One of those seasons. I think in the career of an F1 driver, you always have years where, for some reason, things don’t come your way. Doesn’t matter if it’s luck, racing incidents, whatever. It just never comes together. But Baku was a relief—as soon as I got a chance to fight for a podium, I took it, and I gave the team the podium that I felt we needed and we deserved. And here, it's more a combination of hard work and understanding. I'm extremely proud of the team because we've also struggled a bit at the beginning of the year with race execution, team calls, quali execution. And this weekend, everyone's done a perfect job. Also, the pit stops were perfect. Everyone was perfect, and it's exactly what we all needed.\nQUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR\nQ: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Oscar, can you just talk through the moment when you realised the race was slipping away and what was unfolding? Was it when you realised that everyone had pitted behind you?\nOP: Yeah. When I got told that everyone has pitted except for me, Lando, and Ocon, and then Ocon pitted the next lap, I knew we were in some trouble. So, yeah, I think clearly some things to review. But, yeah, I don't have any answers at the moment.\nQ: (Matt Coch – PlanetF1.com) Max, you've been in championship fights in the final round. You've dominated seasons. Here you are on the precipice of another championship fight—the final round. How do you rate this season against those that you've had previously? Because you've been an underdog throughout, which is a position that you've not had. I guess, previously, you've been sort of toe-to-toe, where here you've really sort of come from behind a little bit more.\nMV: Yeah. I mean, honestly, it's been very strong, but that's also something that I demand of myself after basically 11 years in Formula 1. And, you know, every year, I think you become a bit more all-around. Even in the championship years, there are always things that you look back at and you're like, \"I could have learned a bit more,\" or, \"I could have done a bit more there.\" And this can go from how you set up the car, what you did yourself in terms of execution in a race, or the way that you work together with the team. This year, we just had a really tough first half of the season, as everyone knows. But to still be in this fight—at the same time, I think we can be really proud of it because in the middle of the season, at some point, it was almost – not like you lose motivation – but you don’t really see a way forward of actually winning again in this season. It's almost like you have to hope that 2026 would be better. But we definitely made some really good steps with the car, and in some weekends, for sure, we were in a very competitive state, I would say, where we could win races. But at the same time, we’ve also won races where maybe we shouldn’t have, like today, by making the right call as a team. And then, of course, it’s still up to me to execute it in the best way possible. But that’s, at the end of the day, also a proper team effort. The way I work with my race engineer, with GP, and also the guys in the background—the whole team very close to me—I think we're really well integrated, and we know exactly what we need to ask of each other. That probably helps also when you're in a battle like this, when you’re not the quickest, but you still pretty much maximise everything you've got.\nQ: (Isabelle Barker – The Sun) Oscar, you just seemed so exasperated and fed up at the end there. Obviously, you need to have faith in your team at this point—title showdown. I just wondered how you're going to go about restoring that faith between you and the team, I guess.\nOP: I don't think… It's certainly not a catastrophe. I think we made a wrong decision today. I think that's clear, but it’s not like the world ended. So, obviously, it hurts at the moment, but with time, things will get better. There’s been lots of difficult moments—this year, previous seasons together—and I feel like you always become stronger through some of these moments. But it all depends on how you deal with it. So I’m sure we’ll get through it. But, yeah, obviously, at the moment, it does hurt.\nQ: (Jake Boxall-Legge – Autosport) A question for Max, please. Max, you mentioned that there’s been this sort of gradual process of discovering the car through the season. Can you sort of pinpoint that to any kind of eureka moment—perhaps after the summer break, around Monza time—or has it been a season-long process to kind of get bedded in with this car and understand it?\nMV: It’s probably a bit what Carlos said as well. You try a lot of things, and a lot of things didn’t work. But then I would say since Zandvoort, we found a bit of a direction. And in some tracks, it has worked really well. Some other tracks, we still have limitations—like here, as well. We know that in long medium-speed corners, that doesn’t suit our car, basically.\nPlus, I think also the more medium-downforce tracks, that's normally probably the best for us—medium- to low-downforce, for whatever reason. So, yeah, that’s not this track, and it’s probably not really Abu Dhabi either. There are also some long corners there. But that’s something that we, of course, try to understand more also in the future. I know that the regulations are going to be completely different, but it’s still very important to figure out what you’ve been doing. I don’t want to say “been doing wrong”—it’s just something that you need to get better at, basically. And that’s what we are continuing to do.\nQ: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Max, just building on what you’re talking about in terms of the team coming together and gelling. Also, this is your second F1 title showdown you’re going into after 2021. How different will it feel this time around mentally, do you think? Obviously, that was a very tough year—you and Lewis were tied on points. Then you’re trailing this time and it seemed lost. But is it a different mental situation, or can you take lessons from '21 to now apply?\nMV: No. I’m a lot more relaxed now. I mean, I know that I’m 12 points down. I go in there with just positive energy. I try everything I can. But at the same time, if I don’t win it, I still know that I had an amazing season. So, it doesn’t really matter. It takes a lot of the pressure off. I’m just out there having a good time like I had today. I also started today with, “We’ll see how it goes.” I know that when I sit in the car, I always try to maximise everything I can. And that’s what I’ll try to do in Abu Dhabi, but at the same time, I also know that we need to rely on probably some external factors to have a go at it. But a race like today shows that when you think it's going to be boring and straightforward—it’s not. So, I’m hoping Abu Dhabi is going to be similar.\nQ: (Phil Duncan – PA) Max, ahead of this race, Zak Brown described you as a guy in a horror movie—that you keep coming back, effectively. Do you think you're a little bit in McLaren’s heads and you’ve got them scrambled and that’s why they’re making these sorts of mistakes? And do you think that puts you in the box seat to win this fifth championship in Abu Dhabi?\nMV: He can call me Chucky. Is that short enough for you? I don’t know. I saw it as well. I thought it was quite funny. From my side, I just focus on myself. I know that when I go in the car, I just try to do the best – like, I guess, everyone does. But, yeah, that’s the only thing I can control, right? And that’s the only thing I focus on.\nQ: (Matt Coch – PlanetF1.com) One for Oscar. Zak and Andrea have said throughout the year that the emphasis is on treating you and Lando fairly and giving you equal opportunity—even so much as being willing to sacrifice the Drivers’ Championship to afford you that opportunity. Now that you’re living that scenario, how does that sit with you? And do you think that same approach next year is something you’d sign up to, having been through this experience?\nOP: I don’t think there’s really been too many scenarios where it’s been detrimental to us, really.\nObviously, there was what happened in Monza, but that’s really the only one where maybe you can… Well, a lot of people did argue about it! But I think the last few races have been nothing to do with how we’ve approached things as a team going wrong. On my side, it’s been some things with the car and myself just not working. Clearly, Lando has been very quick the last few weeks. This weekend, I think we got it wrong just because that’s what we thought was the right thing to do – not because we were concerned about what was fair or what was not. So I don’t think we need to change that approach. I think it yields a lot of positives. Yes, there are some tough moments, but there are also a lot of tough moments if you go in a different direction to that. So, yeah, I don’t think we need to change anything.\nQ: (Carlos Miguel – Diario Marca) It’s a question for Carlos. Is this your happiest day in Williams, or was the first podium in Baku happier than this?\nCS: I think it’s my proudest day in Williams. Happiest? Maybe Baku, because I was just so happy to get my first podium for the team. And together with that relief that I was talking about before. This is just… I think I feel really proud of everyone. Just very proud of myself, but mainly the whole team for the weekend that we’ve executed. And, yeah, more proud than happy. And obviously, also happy."}

It's a huge weekend for both of your drivers. Have you sensed the tension go up a notch inside the garage so far?\nZak BROWN: No. It's kind of business as usual. Of course, it's not business as usual. There's a lot riding on the weekend for both our guys, but they are very relaxed. I like the mindset in which they've come in. We're trying to obviously just be business as usual and not think about what the potential outcome can be and do what we've done the first 23 races — maybe if you leave a few out — and go racing again this weekend.\nQ: Well, you said a few weeks ago that you'd rather lose the World Drivers' Championship to Max Verstappen than issue team orders. Sitting here now on the eve of the title decider, do you feel the same way?\nZB: Yes. In the sense of team orders, as long as both drivers have a chance to win the World Championship — which they clearly do sitting here right now — then it's business as usual. They're free to race. Obviously, we'll be practical and realistic. If, as the weekend develops, as the race develops, it becomes clear that one has a significantly better chance than the other, then we're a team that wants to win the Drivers' Championship, and we will race accordingly, to do whatever we can to get that driver in front to try and win the race. So, you know, our team orders have been around giving equal opportunity to win the championship. But if, as the race plays out, it becomes clear that both can't, then we're going to do what's in the best interest of the team and try and win the Drivers' Championship.\nQ: What do you say to people who might then accuse you of doing a U-turn on the way you've gone racing so far this year?\nZB: I don't think it's a U-turn. We're going to start the weekend like we have the other 23, which is going in, giving both drivers equal opportunity. I think last year, once it became clear that Lando had the best chance to catch Max and Oscar was almost statistically out of it — in Baku — we then asked Oscar to support Lando, and it ended up being Lando who supported Oscar in that particular race, and Oscar won the race. So, we're going to use common sense. We're not going to throw away a Drivers' Championship over a sixth and seventh place, a third and a fourth place, a fifth and a sixth place if one of our drivers doesn't have the opportunity. I think everything we do, we do with the drivers so they know what the game plan is for this weekend. And, you know, kind of outside of our racing team, you're a bit damned if you do, damned if you don't. And so we're going to just stay true to our racing principles. We want to win the Constructors' — which we've done — we want to win the Drivers', and so we'll see how the race plays out.\nQ: If you ask Oscar to move over on Sunday evening, are you confident that he will?\nZB: Yes. Our drivers have always complied with team wishes, just as we comply with their wishes. So, I've got no doubt either of our drivers will continue to race as they've done brilliantly — in the best interest of the team.\nQ: Final one from me. Win or lose on Sunday, how will you reflect on 2025?\nZB: Awesome season. Tied Red Bull for clinching the Constructors’. Really would have been nice to break the record, but they tag teamed me — 14 wins, both drivers have seven wins, celebrated our 200th win. It's been a spectacular year. It's been probably the best year McLaren's had in, I don't know, 25, 30 years. So, I don't think you can reflect on anything other than an awesome year. Obviously, if we don't win, we'll be disappointed, but we'll reflect back on the season and it was a hell of a season.\nQ: Okay. Zak, thank you for that. I'm sure there'll be more questions for you in a minute. Laurent, can we come to you now? We had Max in the press conference yesterday. He came across as incredibly relaxed. Is that what you're seeing as well?\nLaurent MEKIES: He is incredibly relaxed. There is no acting there. Honestly, he has been like that… For the little that I've seen of him in the second part of the year, he has been like that in the bad moment and the positive moment. He is very much embracing the approach we have. We take it race by race. We never quite looked at the championship points. We always felt that you go to a race, you try to get the car in the right window, which is difficult enough, and in the second part of the year, if we were doing that, it meant that you would have a chance to fight for the win. And then on Sunday night, you look each other in the eyes and you know if you're doing a good job or not. And the points are just the consequence. And I guess that approach has given both Max and the team the confidence of focusing on the right things and not to feel pressure but instead to feel a privilege to be in a historical fight, in a historical comeback?\nQ: How are you approaching the weekend?\nLM: Exactly in the same way, really. We try to get the car in the right window. We don't get that easily on any track. Qatar has been particularly difficult. Vegas was not easy either. If we do that, it doesn't mean that Max will be on pole, or that he will win the race, but it means he will be close enough to these guys to fight for it. And then at that moment, whatever happens behind him is not in our control. So, we don't think about it.\nQ: If Max were to do it, has this been his best season?\nLM: It's you guys that are here to judge how historical a season is compared to the others. I think whether or not Max will win, it's probably fair to say that the world discovered an even more extraordinary Max this season, after his fourth world title. A bit because of the magnitude of the comeback. A bit because, as you say, he has been so relaxed, so well seated in the team. Embracing so much that challenge with the right spirit. A bit also because we have seen him racing elsewhere. I think it has all taken a bit of a part of our heart when we have seen him spending his free weekends being a new dad, racing with GT cars around the world. And I don't know, it's up to you guys to say if in that case, that will become the best of his titles. But for sure, in terms of whatever happens next, the scale of the comeback is something that hopefully will go in a few history books.\nQ: Final one for me. Can we change tack and talk about Isack Hadjar? You announced him as Max's teammate for 2026 a few days ago. What are your expectations from him?\nLM: Isack has had an unbelievable first season. There is no doubt that in terms of starting point — so where he started in January — the starting point was outstanding. Then we are strong believers not only in the raw talent, but also the ability of the drivers to develop. We have seen so many champions developing through the years, doing things that they had not done in the car a few races before. We've seen that with Isack this year too. We’ve seen him making stuff in the car that he was not doing three races before. So, to answer your question, we expect — we would like him to continue onto that path. We don't see it as a landing point. We see it as another start for him to continue to develop, to continue to impress us, to continue to surprise us. And you will expect that in the second year. You will expect that in the third year, perhaps in the fourth year. So that's a little bit the journey for us together.\nQ: Thank you. Jonathan, let's come to you now. Can we start by talking about Max Verstappen? You have insider knowledge of him from your time at Red Bull. What makes him such a potent force in a situation like this, in a title showdown?\nJonathan WHEATLEY: I think it's not his first rodeo. He's been here before. He has a coolness and a calm — which Laurent's talking about — and I think that permeates through the team. If everyone in the team seems calm, starting with the driver — I’m sure you've got the same situation as well, Zak, in your team — then the team gains confidence from it. To be in this situation is what we dream of. I'm loving the situation that two friends of mine are finding themselves in this year, because you can work your entire life to be in this situation. And the great thing with Max is he's been here before.\nQ: Well, can we talk about when he was here before in 2021, against Lewis Hamilton? How did he deal with the pressure then?\nJW: Yeah. I think it was a different Max then. There was a hunger about him. That whole season, there was a frisson of energy about the whole season. There was everything that you'd want in a Formula 1 championship — great rivalries, on-track clashes, and what have you. It came to a crescendo here, which I think… We’re looking at another crescendo on Sunday. So excited. I think for the sport, it’s such a great new story to have three great drivers in contention for a Drivers' World Championship, and I hope I can have a bit of time to enjoy that as well as our own race on Sunday.\nQ: Well, let's talk about your own race. Let's bring this back to Sauber. Every team wants to end the season on a high. What does that look like for you this weekend?\nJW: Well, there's a couple of things. First of all, I feel tremendously proud to be part of the Sauber journey. I was there the first time they ran a car in testing in Barcelona, and I was there for the first race in Kyalami, where they actually finished fifth in the first race. Since then, 617 races. We have Peter Sauber with us this weekend. Peter and I get on brilliantly. To be able to show our respect for Peter as a team — and, of course, what we want to do is sign off on this incredible journey in Formula 1 for the Sauber name by making him as proud as we can on Sunday and putting to bed, respectfully, the Sauber legacy as we move forward into becoming the Audi F1 Team.\n1 / 4\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 05: Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal of Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber Zak Brown, Chief Executive Officer of McLaren and Laurent Mekies, Team Principal of Oracle Red Bull Racing in the Team Principals Press Conference  during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 05, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Bryn Lennon/Getty Images)\nQUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR\nQ: (Ian Parkes – RacingNews365.com) Question for you, Zak. You mentioned earlier that it has been an awesome season, and you detailed the many reasons why. But surely, if one of your drivers does not win the world title on Sunday, that part of it in isolation will be seen as failure, bearing in mind both have won seven Grands Prix this season, and one or the other has led the Drivers' Championship since the start of the season?\nZB: Yeah. Clearly, it'll be a disappointment, but Max is not an easy four-time World Champion to knock off his perch. He's won seven races, eight races? Seven races. So, it's not like he's won two. He's had equally as competitive a racing season. You've got three drivers fighting for the championship that have all had spectacular years.\nQ: (Scott Mitchell-Malm – The Race) A question for Zak as well. The potential for distraction for the drivers or noise has obviously never been greater because it is the title showdown, and the allegations of bias or favouritism that you've had to deal with at times over the last few months in particular seem to be stronger and louder than ever. How do you feel about those? Have you seen what's been claimed this week, and what's your thought on how that's gone down?\nZB: All that's really important to us is how the team operates and works together and works with our drivers, so we block it all out. I have seen it. Some of the comments that you see are very uninformed but it's sport, it's emotional, people are entitled to their opinions, and I can't go around correcting everyone's views. But you do see some nonsense out there.\nQ: (Jon Noble – The Race) Another one to Zak. The ‘Papaya Rules’ have obviously been a big talking point all season. It’s put you on the receiving end of some criticism. Has the pain been worth it? Are you comfortable with all the decisions, including Monza, that were made? And over the winter, is there something you need to talk and review and discuss going forward, or are you absolutely committed that this is the way McLaren runs F1, full stop?\nZB: Oh, we're definitely committed to giving both drivers equal opportunity to win the World Championship. I think you're always… Even when you win, on Monday, you talk about what you could have done differently or better. So we're constantly evolving as a racing team. But the fundamentals of having two drivers that would give equal opportunity to win, that won't change.\nDo we look back and have lots of learnings? I remember when we finished first and second in Spain, our debrief on Monday was about eight things that were close calls that we could have done better. I think that’s the nature of a Formula 1 team — to always evaluate and go, “What could we have done differently, what could we have done better?” I think in sport you're going to win some, you're going to lose some. Of course, when you've made mistakes, you wish you hadn't, but that's just not realistic. I've yet to see any person or team in any sport have the perfect season. So, we're no different than that. But fundamentally, the way we go racing — that won’t change.\nQ: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Laurent, just picking up on your comments about Max. So for him to go into this weekend — having worked his way back in — he's very relaxed. He said there's nothing to lose. But Zak likened him to a bad guy in a horror movie that just keeps coming back time after time. To have someone who's just so potent and won't miss a beat — is that a psychological edge you think that he's got going into this weekend? And if Jonathan wants to weigh in on that as well, then more than welcome.\nLM: Not sure about the horror movie, but that was a cool…\nZB: He’s ‘Chucky’ now. I traded notes with him and called him Chucky. I like it!\nLM: Look — this guy never gets it wrong, you know. Max just never does a mistake. I say that like, you know, he keeps surprising us every day. You throw him out there, sometimes the car is great, sometimes it's a touch less great, something like we would hope so, and he doesn't miss a start, he doesn't miss tyre management, he doesn't miss an overtaking. He is just the way he is. And as Jonathan touched on earlier, it is true that it gives a lot of confidence to the whole team. It is true that it fits so well with the general approach this team has on how you go racing — taking maximum risk, accepting the pain when the risk goes over the edge. If you think back to the 2,000 people in Milton Keynes that have been doing the magic in the shadows, trying to get that car back to life in the second part of the year — obviously, that creates a great connection, and yes, it gives great confidence.\nJW: I mean, honestly, I don't think I can... Laurent summed it up very eloquently.\nQ: (Phil Duncan – PA) Zak, there's a bit of a narrative that perhaps McLaren are running scared of Max, that Lando's running a bit scared of Max, and that he's in your heads. Just your response to that — do you think that is the case?\nZB: No. Max is an awesome driver. Four-time World Champion. Arguably, definitely, one of the greatest ever. It's awesome racing against Max. It's awesome racing against Red Bull. It's one of the best teams ever. So, to be sitting here in the final race with two drivers — it's awesome. It's sport. We enjoy it. It’s kind of like our Game Seven – I'm a baseball guy, so forgive me for that. But this is what we dream of. As Jonathan said, to be sitting here racing against an awesome team like Red Bull, an awesome racing driver like Max, going down to the last race, it's mega exciting.\nQ: (Christian Menath – Motorsport-Magazin.com) First part of the question for you, Zak. Talking about team tactics — could this also include a situation where Oscar has to back up Max in the race? And then for you, following up, Laurent: is there any situation you can imagine where Yuki can play a part in the championship fight to help Max?\nZB: I mean, we're going to race cleanly. Obviously, strategy comes into play, but I like everyone on the Formula 1 grid, and I think we're here to race hard, race clean. So that's exactly what I expect — how the race will play out. We all have multiple cars, etcetera, so you'll be smart and strategic, but I think it'll be a very healthy battle to the finish.\nLM: Completely agree with Zak. I think it's even quite refreshing to see that we're not even discussing whether we are going to race cleanly or not. It’s a given that the guys out there will race cleanly. Do we need a strong Yuki to put as many cars between Max and the rest of the group if we are strong enough to lead with Max? Yes. So, we need a strong Yuki. We need a strong Mercedes. We need a strong Ferrari. We need a strong everything. But as Zak said, it's going to be, I'm sure, a fantastic fight, and it will keep us all very awake until the last lap.\nQ: (Maria Guidotti – GrainingF1.com) Question for Zak. The values and team spirit are highly valuable and also make you a difference in the whole lineup on the grid. But looking at the drivers' standings, is it not really realistic enough to support 100% the leader, so Lando?\nZB: You've got two drivers. I think we've seen many times over the years — three drivers coming into the final race, and the driver in third wins the championship. So, no. We're going to wait and see how the race plays out. Sitting here right now, I kind of view it as all three drivers have an equal opportunity to win the Grand Prix. So, until that changes, we're going to go racing as usual.\nQ: (Jad Deaibes – Annahar) My question for you, Laurent. Just reflecting about the 2025 season — since you took over as Team Principal, Red Bull has been on a stronger resurgence, and Max is once again fighting for the title. In your view, what were the key elements missing before, and what has driven this noticeable uplift in performance?\nLM: The credit for the turnaround — the spectacular turnaround of form — is very simple. It's down to 2,000 people that you never see back in Milton Keynes, who simply didn’t want to give up. It didn’t matter how hard the first part of the season was, how hard the changes that were made in the middle of the season were for them to digest — it didn’t matter. They just didn’t want to give up. That’s what they have managed to achieve – a historic turnaround. They are the guys and girls behind the fact that everything started to click together. They unlocked a little bit of performance, and a little bit more performance led to even more risk. We fell quite a few times. I’m sure you guys recall Budapest. I’m sure you recall Brazil qualifying. You don’t take risk for free. Nothing is for free. You take risk, you fall, you get back on your feet, and you love the way you're going racing altogether. And everybody is in the same boat. Max is in the same boat, 2,000 people are in the same boat, our shareholders are in the same boat. That’s where the secret is — a united group that just doesn’t want to give up.\nQ: (Tim Hauraney – TSN) Question for Laurent. You had mentioned a few times that Max is pretty relaxed coming into this weekend. Removing the experience side of this — where do you think that comes from, and why do you think that is?\nLM: Difficult to talk for him, but let me put it this way. Whatever happens in these next three days, the turnaround has been sensational. I think the team should take pride in that. Max should take huge pride in that. So, I guess that's the first point. The second point is, as both Jonathan and Zak mentioned, we all work all our life — and that applies to drivers as well — to be involved in this sort of moment, where the intensity is sky-high, the pressure is sky-high. But that's what we're really here for – to be in that fight. So, I think if you combine that and the experience, and the fact that even now, even with a sensational turnaround, you're still coming to the last race with a 12-point deficit — winning is not enough. Your main competitor needs to be out of the podiums for you. So it's still very remote. The combination of all of that and the approach with which we go racing — concentrate on this race, get the car in the right window — makes that we are all trying to enjoy it more than to think about the pressure.\nQ: (David Schneider – Hershey Shiga Global) Question for Laurent. It must have been a very difficult decision to let Yuki go. You have had a lot of praise for him this season, and you worked with him at VCARB where you also appreciated his work and contribution. What do you expect of him in 2026? What is his new mission? And do you think there's a pathway back into Formula 1 for him?\nLM: So, at first — yes, you're right. It has been a very difficult decision to take. The second seat in Oracle Red Bull Racing is not an easy one. We have a tough car to drive. And of course, we have tried everything we could to support Yuki. At some stage, we had to make the difficult call between where we were seeing that going for the following years. I hope, and I think, that Yuki will get another chance. He will be reserve driver with us next year. You never know what's going to happen. We have been quite famous in making fairly swift driver decisions in the past. I recall one moment — at the end of the 2024 season, Yuki was driving very well. It was very difficult for him to digest. Liam was getting the promotion in Red Bull Racing. He went into the winter thinking, was he going to get the chance one day or not? He came back, and we set ourselves with the team at the time the objective to maximise everything — to shoot for the stars. Three races after, he was driving in that Oracle Red Bull Racing team. So you never know what the future holds. I'm sure everyone in this room and beyond has experienced setbacks — sometimes hard setbacks. That’s a setback for him. But I am confident that he has a lot in him that will allow him to have another opportunity.\nQ: (Thomas Maher – PlanetF1.com) A question for Zak, please. Zak, assuming one of your drivers does win the title this weekend, you're going to have a pretty devastated driver alongside — surrounded by a jubilant team. Have you any mechanisms or plans in place on how to help that driver process the disappointment and move into the winter without feeling too devastated?\nZB: We'll tackle that when and if that happens. We've got two awesome guys. They've been great team players. They understand it. We understand the emotions of the sport and the highs and lows.\nWe've had plenty of highs and lows this year, and we'll just put our arm around him — if that's the situation — and come back and give it a go again next year. And hopefully, we're in the same position.\nQ: (Carlo Platella – FormulaPassion.it) Question for Laurent. Red Bull was one of the teams that developed the most this season. Was it because you always believed in the possibility of catching McLaren, or were there other reasons behind that?\nLM: I think it was a combination of factors. First, as we said earlier, it's not a team that likes to give up. The second aspect is that there was nowhere to hide. The 2025 car had not started at a level that was good enough to allow us to fight for the title. It would probably have been wishful thinking at that stage to just turn the page and hope for a better result in '26. So, we decided to continue developing — a bit because we don’t give up, a bit because we wanted some answers, because yes, regulations are changing drastically, but fundamentally you will have the same people using the same tools, the same analysis, the same KPIs for how to develop a fast car. So we wanted to get to the bottom of what had limited this year's project. Of course, in doing so, you lose 2026 development time, but we felt it was the right investment to make.\nQ: (Leonid Kliuev – Grande Premio Brazil) Question for Zak. If in the race you need Oscar to let Lando through or, indeed, hold up Max — how confident are you that Oscar will agree?\nZB: I think I already answered that — our drivers are great team players. They've demonstrated that they'll work on behalf of the team's interest — and of course, theirs as well — so I'm very confident."}

One of the big tech stories coming into this weekend is the 25-lap limit on each set of tyres. Can we start by you telling us why you've imposed that limit?\nMario ISOLA: Yeah. That comes from last year. As you know, we had a couple of punctures during the race, but after the race, we also analysed the tyres used, as we always do. And it was clear that they were worn at 100% or even more. There was already an indication on Saturday after the Sprint, with 25–26 laps they were quite worn. So, during the race, going up to 34–35 laps basically was pushing the tyres to run on a high severity circuit without a tread. And when you are running without tread, there is a big risk of puncture. You damage the construction. So, we made the proposal to the Sporting Committee in March to limit the mileage, and then we decided to go in this direction.\nQ: We've been here before a couple of years ago. It was an 18-lap limit, right? Why the increase to 25 this time?\nMI: Because it was a different issue. Two years ago, it was a damage on the sidewall caused by the kerbs. Then we made some analysis on tyres, and we asked for modification of the kerbs, which the circuit did. It was successful, so we didn't find the damage on the sidewall, on the compound of the sidewall. But in that case, it was a different problem with the excessive wear, especially on the front left.\nQ: Let’s throw it forward to 2026. Like the teams, Pirelli has been juggling the current season with developments for '26. Just how difficult has it been for you to develop those new compounds and tyres without a 2026 car on which to test them?\nMI: It is a situation we know from the past, when we had to move from 13 to 18-inch, or with the wider tyres in 2017. It was important to work with the teams, not only on track but also with the virtual model of the tyre and with the help of the teams and their simulators. We had feedback on the expected performance of the car. So, we have worked in parallel between the virtual environment and testing on track with the mule cars. Now we have finalised the development. Construction was homologated in September, and now we’ve just decided the compounds for next year. So let’s see in Abu Dhabi.\nQ: You’re testing them in Abu Dhabi in a couple of weeks' time. What are the headlines for us about the new compounds?\nMI: Basically, we decided to homologate five compounds from C1 to C5 because we found compounds with a good delta lap time between them. Not knowing the cars, obviously we wanted to have a delta that is slightly bigger than the current one. They are well spaced in terms of degradation. So, the idea was to have the flexibility to move softer or harder depending on what we find in the first races of next season.\nQ: Steve, why don't we come to you now? While we're talking 2026, tell us what's going on in Enstone at the minute with regards to next year's car?\nSteve NIELSEN: Well, probably like all the other teams, Enstone's a hive of activity. If you go in all the departments, all you'll see is parts for next year's car – chassis and gearboxes and all sorts of stuff. I think we’re about to go into what is, certainly in my memory, one of the shortest winter breaks. Somebody told me yesterday that from the chequered flag in Abu Dhabi to the first time our car goes on the track is 36 days, and that includes the compulsory winter shutdown. So, work that would normally have taken place over two or three months has been compressed into literally four weeks. The overlap between finishing racing in 2025 and producing the 2026 car is massive. We are racing here this year, but Enstone is completely on 2026 and has been for some time.\nQ: I can understand that. But how important is it to end this '25 season with a bit of positive momentum? We've seen an upswing in performance at the last couple of races. Has that been track specific, or have you found something with the car?\nSN: I think it’s a combination of quite a few things, honestly. It’s an upswing because the bar’s been set pretty low for us recently, which is not great. It’s not where we want to be. It is true that the last couple of races we picked up a bit. It’s probably something to do with track temperature – cooler temperatures in Brazil, certainly cooler in Las Vegas. Temperatures are a bit higher here, so that might hurt us more than we’d like. But of course, we want to go into the winter with a nice result and a positive feeling for our workforce, our sponsors, and everybody else. The amount of work ahead of us in the winter is massive, but it's a bit of a springboard if at the last race, or the last few races, you have some nice results. So, we're trying.\nQ: Steve, you've now been back at the team for three months. What has impressed you the most about what you've found at Enstone?\nFV: The weather!\nSN: The weather you say? [laughs] I mean, it’s a cliché, but it’s a racing team. It's full of people with racing spirit. It’s had mixed results recently, but I think there’s a passion and a will to put it back to where it has been in the past. The dedication is huge, from the top to the bottom of the company. It’s my job to coordinate that, strengthen the areas that are good, re-strengthen the areas where we are weak, and bring some common sense and consistency to the management. There’s been too many changes over the last few years at Enstone. I don't criticise any of my predecessors, but it's time for patience, common sense, and consistency. We want the team to be better, and patience and Formula 1 don't go well together, but that’s the task. We have to spend the next few years building, and it’s a slow, grinding process. It’s F1 – there are no magic bullets. You just have to fix a million details – in place, people. More than anything, it’s a people business. So, I've kind of relearned that lesson, if you like.\nQ: Fred, coming to you now. Your drivers’ comments in the media in recent weeks have attracted a lot of attention. Let’s start by talking about that. How difficult has it been for you to manage that situation?\nFred VASSEUR: Well, honestly, I perfectly understand the frustration of the drivers after a crash, or even more when they are not responsible, or a difficult performance. We have exactly the same frustration in the garage or on the pit wall. The most important is to react after the frustration. I think, honestly, the frustration sometimes is good. The most important thing is to be able to react from the Monday morning and to be focused on the next one, on the next year also, and on the future. You can’t imagine, and I would be even more frustrated, if the drivers were happy when we have a tough weekend.\nQ: But when you've discussed it with the drivers and the attention they’re bringing to the team in that way, how did those conversations go? Were they apologetic? What did they say?\nFV: I don't think we went so far. It was not a drama, honestly. You know my two drivers – they are like they are, and I perfectly accept this. I’m fully aligned with this frustration – we have exactly the same on the pit wall. When you have a crash in Brazil and Charles is out of the race because Piastri and Antonelli are crashing together, for sure we have huge frustration. We put so much effort during the season to try to fight for P2, and in one tenth of a second you are losing a potential P2. It’s huge. Or when you don’t have the good race because we have a technical issue or whatever. But this frustration, I think, is part of the DNA of what we are doing. Then from driver to driver, there have different ways to express their frustration, but everybody has exactly the same.\nQ: You're 53 points behind Mercedes, 13 behind Red Bull. Let's talk about that Constructors’ Championship battle. How do you see it playing out over these last couple of weekends?\nFV: I would prefer to be P2 with some points ahead of the others, but honestly, I'm not paying attention to this gap. I even didn't know last year when we arrived in Abu Dhabi what was the gap with McLaren, and you told me in the press conference. We have to be focused on ourselves to do the best that we can in the next two weekends. We have two-and-a-half races to go, and we still have some good points on the table. Let’s be focused on ourselves to try to do the best, and we’ll see in Abu Dhabi where we are.\nQ: Fred, final one from me. This is the last time you're going to be in a press conference this year. Can you reflect for a moment on the 2025 season, why it panned out as it did, and at what point in the season did you realise that perhaps it was going to be tougher than you were hoping for?\nFV: We didn’t start in the best way with the double disqualification in China. This cost us tons of points compared to our direct competitors. Quite early in the season, McLaren was so dominating in the first four or five events that we realised it would be very difficult for 2025. It meant that we decided very early in the season – I think it was the end of April – to switch to '26. It was a tough call. Perhaps I also underestimated a little bit the call on the psychological side, because when you still have 20 races to go, or 18 races to go, and you know that you won’t bring any aero development, it's quite tough to manage psychologically. But overall, we continued to push. We brought some mechanical upgrades, and we are trying to do a better job operationally, and this is the DNA of our sport. We have to accept this. It was a call, and I’m still confident with the call that we made. Now let’s fight for P2 with these conditions.\n1 / 3\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 28: Frederic Vasseur, Team Principal of Scuderia Ferrari in the Team Principals Press Conference during Sprint Qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 28, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar. (Photo by Clive Rose/Getty Images)\nQUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR\nQ: (Stuart Codling – Autosport) Question for Mario. You said five compounds for 2026. That means the C6 experiment is over. Could you explain in a little more detail the thought process behind dropping the C6 and not progressing with that idea? Because it's one of those things that seemed like a good idea at the time.\nMI: Yeah. Simply because the C6 that we found was too close to the C5, and we already saw this year that when they are so close and there is no clear difference, it's a little bit useless to bring both. So, homologating the C6 was an automatic way to skip one level – that means C3, C4, C5, or C3, C4, C6. At that point, it's useless to have an extra compound. So, we will continue to look for a C6 for 2027 as soon as we have an idea on the performance of the cars next year. And obviously, next year we can test with the current cars, with the proper cars, and we will have better feedback.\nQ: (Leonid Kliuev – Grande Prêmio) Question to Steve and Fred. Adrian Newey was, of course, confirmed as Team Principal for 2026. How does it change the dynamics and collaboration between you guys, between team principals?\nSN: Do you want me to go? Honestly, not at all, I don't think. As Fred’s already said, I think we're quite inward-looking. We have the structure we have for our own reasons. I’m sure other people have different structures for their own reasons. But in terms of interaction – I think that was your question – I don't think it changes anything for us, honestly.\nFV: Nothing to add.\nQ: (Diletta Colombo – AutoMoto) Question for Fred. You mentioned before how tough this season has been for your team, but are there any positives to take from 2025?\nFV: Yes. You have always positives, even in a tough season. I think we had a decent recovery in terms of performance. We were back on the podium – Mexico, Austin. I would say São Paulo we were not far away. That means we were on the right way. It’s good for the team, at least for the psychological side. You always improve a little bit everywhere, in every single area. It's the best preparation for 2026. But the most important of this call that you mentioned is that we agreed quite early that we would put a maximum of energy on the future. That means then we have to react as a team, even when you have tough weekends, to come back Monday morning at the factory and continue to push and develop and work all together. I understood the question from Tom, but honestly, we had a good reaction to tough sessions and tough weekends. Let's see next year if we did a good job this season also.\nQ: (Ian Parkes – RacingNews365) Another question for you, Fred. Looking at Lewis specifically, it's obviously been a very difficult year for him, as we all know. But positively, what has he brought to the team that's had a good impact? And additionally, what do you want to see more from him going forward into next season?\nFV: The season was difficult. I think it’s a mathematical contestation, not a feeling. But the most important is the reaction. The most important is the energy that you are putting in to push the team again and again, to try to understand what the issues are and to fix them – and it’s details by details. For sure, we knew that it would be difficult from the first quarter of the season. But at the end of the day, when we had podiums in a row one month ago, I think it's the job of everybody. It's not the job of one driver or one engineer. It's the job of 1,500 people at the factory, from the two drivers, from all the engineers. Collectively, the reaction was good, and Lewis is part of the reaction, for sure.\nQ: (Jack Smith – Motorsport Monday) A question for Steve. Before Franco was confirmed for next season, one of the things he told us in Mexico was that he feels he could prove himself by being in a preseason situation for the first time, having not done that with either you or Williams. Aside from what you feel he can offer on track and in race conditions, what do you think he can offer the team in terms of development of the 2026 car in next year’s preseason testing?\nSN: Well, tricky to answer because I'm not sure what we're going to face in 2026 preseason testing yet. The car’s not on the track. Franco is early in his career. He's learning. He has some weekends where I’m sure he would look back and maybe do things differently, and other weekends which are more successful. But it’s learning – it's like learning anything for the first time. He’s on that journey, and we're going to help him with that. But specifically, to identify what issues we may have in preseason 2026 – I don't know the answer yet. I’m not sure anybody does.\nQ: (Gianluigi Paolucci – F1Generale.com) A question for Fred. Did you expect the kind of performance you had in FP1 here?\nFV: Well, I think we don't have to pay too much attention to FP1. This is true from the beginning of the season at every single event. On our side, we had some issues with the power steering. It's not a secret – Charles was vocal on the radio. We have to fix it for the Sprint Quali now, but it's OK-ish now. If you look at last year – I think it was a relevant classification – all over the weekend the order changed each session. That means the field is so tight that with different conditions, different levels of wind, different track time... Last year we had five sessions and five different classifications. It means we need to keep this mindset, be open-minded, and try to adapt the car to the next session, not to the previous one. Let’s see what we can do for Sprint Quali.\nQ: Mario, can I just bring you in on a 2026 matter? You're staying with the 18 inches, but the tyres are going to be narrower. How’s that been affecting performance during testing?\nMI: We had to redesign completely the tyre with a new profile, optimising the footprint. Obviously, because of the new aero package, we expect higher speeds on the straight, but at the same level of load – or similar – in cornering. That means that overheating could be an issue. We have worked to try to minimise the overheating, that we know drivers don’t like that, while keeping some thermal degradation. So the targets were clear, but obviously on a smaller size, it’s a little bit more difficult unless you don’t penalise the performance quite a lot. That is not the target, obviously.\nQ: (Christian Menath – Motorsport-Magazin.com) Question for the two team representatives. There was a meeting yesterday about driving guidelines. What is the way you want to go forward with it – destroy the guidelines and just rely on the system and the expertise of the stewards, or keep improving the guidelines?\nFV:  I think we are all a bit schizophrenic. We want to have consistency – that means in this case, you need to have guidelines and to follow the guidelines. But at one stage, we also want to introduce a human factor able to judge – not just to follow the guidelines. At one stage the situation becomes difficult. This is also coming, I think, compared to the past, from the fact that the field is closer probably, and we have more often these kinds of situations. But I think to keep a human factor in the decision makes sense. Because it's not just about having the wheel nut one millimetre in front of the mirror or below the mirror – for the drivers, it's very difficult to assess whether they have the front axle ahead of the mirror or not. Honestly, it’s quite impossible when you are in the car. At the end of the day, having a human factor is important. But we have to accept that the decision can be a bit different if it's not just a mathematical approach.\nSN: Yeah, I'd agree with Fred, honestly. OK, I'd mostly agree with Fred then. [laughs] No two situations are the same. And as Fred said, there’s always going to be a human factor. I think this is a sport that wants to measure everything to the nth degree and have an exact science. When you have human judgment involved, there are going to be variations. I think we just accept that as part of the sport, to be honest. There’s always going to be differences of opinion. It’s not only in this sport – it happens in other sports as well. And I think we just trust in the FIA. They’ve got fine people doing it, and we’re happy with it.\nQ: (Ian Parkes – RacingNews365) Fred, another question for you. You mentioned earlier that you opted to shut down development in April, and you mentioned you underestimated the psychological impact that had on the team, and it was tough to manage. Just what processes and steps were put in place following that decision to manage that impact? And how much of an impact did it have on the drivers, and has that resulted in their performance as well on track?\nFV: Yeah. First, this decision was shared by everybody in the team. At one stage, you look at the championship and say: OK, it will be very difficult to come back on McLaren with the delta pace, the delta points. So you say: OK, let’s focus the resources we have in the wind tunnel on 2026. On the other hand, we can still continue to develop the mechanical side and bring some upgrades on the car, except aero. And that’s what we did – and it was a good exercise, honestly. For sure, the drivers were part of this decision. They are fully committed to the project. It’s something we have to share altogether. In this kind of situation, you have to act as a team, and that’s what we did in that stage of the season.\nQ: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Fred, another one for you. Just picking up on Steve’s point about the very, very short off-season this year. How much of an added challenge is that? And did that factor as well into the decision to switch early to ’26, because it’s going to be such a tight turnaround?\nFV: No, because you do the reverse planning from T1 [2026]. That means we have to release everything a bit earlier than we did last year. For sure, the fact that you have now the mandatory shutdown at Christmas – it’s good for us and for the family. But we just have to anticipate everything by 10 days. The exercise is the same. It’s more for track operations that it’s difficult because it’s not after the chequered flag. The week after the chequered flag we still have the tests in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi – that means it's not 36 days, it's seven days less. But no – when I say this, I’m not speaking about me or the drivers. I’m speaking first about the mechanics. It’s much more difficult for them than for everybody else. We have to think about them. It’s true this exercise will be tricky.\nQ: Fred, Steve, can we expand on that? You talk about it being tough on the mechanics. Of course, there's no test team anymore in Formula 1. It's going to be the race teams that are testing the cars in January at Barcelona. How do you ensure that everyone gets enough rest after what's been a long 24-race season?\nSN: Well, you have to forward plan. As I think Fred just said, you can’t wait till the chequered flag and then decide what you're going to do. So, we’ve been looking at that sort of stuff – staff rotation and so on – months out, in order to make sure that we've got the workforce available to build cars and go testing. We're building next year's car in December. I've never known that before. So it’s a completely different way of looking at it. But that work and scheduling starts months before.\nFV: Yes. It’s true that during the racing season, you can imagine having a kind of rotation for the test. We’ll have to bring everybody because we’ll probably have some night shifts also. That means all the mechanics will be in Barcelona and Bahrain. Let’s think about them – what we can do to give them some free time during the sessions and so on. And keep in mind – we are doing the best job in the world.\nQ: (Ian Parkes – RacingNews365) Mario, Tom mentioned earlier that next year's tyres haven’t had the 2026 car to run on. What plans are in place for next season to get a better understanding of how the tyres are interacting with the cars? Are there any plans in place, and how quickly can you react should changes need to be made?\nMI: Next year we have the usual plan of 40 days with all the teams. The plan has already been defined and shared with the teams. The point is that for sure we cannot change the allocation for the first five races. We are producing the tyres for all the pre-season tests, and logistics is a nightmare also for us because we had to start the production as soon as possible to supply the tyres to the pre-season test – which is not only three days, but nine – plus the first five races that are overseas. So, the allocation has been defined already. But depending on the results of the first five races, we can change in the second part of the year. If we want to go a bit harder or softer, we have at least flexibility."}

It was a very tough weekend for you and Ferrari last time out in Qatar. Having had all the post-race debriefs, do you understand a little better the cause of all the problems?\nCharles LECLERC: Well, we have ideas of what we could have tested. Whether these are the solutions is another story. So, we don't have the 100% solution to it, but we've got ideas of what we didn't try during that weekend. And, obviously, we're clearly doing something wrong during the weekend, as we weren't strong from FP1 to the race. So yeah, we have ideas. Whether we have the clear solution, I don't think so.\nQ: So, do you think it was track specific, or do you think it could recur here in Abu Dhabi as well?\nCL: No. Surely, it's been accentuated by the fact that Qatar was never going to be a track where we would be strong. But we didn’t perform at the level we should be anyway. So yeah, we should have done better even though the characteristics of the track were not good for us. But for this weekend, I expect us to be back to where we should be, which is probably third team or something like that.\nQ: Now, this is the last Thursday press conference of the season. Can we just get your thoughts on 2025 as a whole, please? How you feel it's gone for you personally and for Ferrari?\nCL: Personally, I'm quite satisfied. I think it's been a strong season on my side. You always try to improve from one season to the other, and that's what I've tried to do this year. And I'm satisfied with the work. Then, unfortunately, the performances are not where they should be, and I'm not as satisfied about the result side of things and the performance we've shown. Especially after last year that we ended up strong, the expectation was another one. But yeah, we've pushed. I think we reacted well as a team from the first race to the last race, trying to turn that situation around. It wasn't easy because we didn’t have that many upgrades, as we are focusing mostly on 2026. But yeah, I think we performed well as a team on track. Then what we are missing eventually is the performance on the car. And for that, I hope that next year will be better.\nQ: Final one from me. World title showdown this weekend. Who do you think is going to be the world champion come Sunday night?\nCL: I don't know. Again, I've changed my mind so many times this year. I thought it was Oscar, then I thought it was Max, then I don't know. I probably think it's going to be Lando. Twelve points is still significant. So, if nothing big happens to Lando, I think Lando will take it.\nQ: Isack, let's come to you now. Many congratulations on the new job. Huge moment in your career. Just tell us what does this race seat with Red Bull Racing mean to you?\nIsack HADJAR: Yeah. It's a very good moment in my career, that's for sure. For all the hard work through the years being rewarded now. Obviously, it's just the beginning of a new journey, but yeah, I'm very excited and stepping into a new era of Formula 1 as well. I think it's a very good timing.\nQ: Can you describe the moment you found out? Who told you?\nIH: Yeah, it was, again, like, there was no very cool phone call where I pick up the phone and it’s like “Yeah, you're a Red Bull Racing driver,” you know? It's not really how it worked.\nQ: How did it work?\nGeorge RUSSELL: They sent a pigeon with a note.\nIH: Ha! It was just a talk with Helmut I had. He made me understand I was driving for Red Bull, and I had to deliver. That’s it.\nQ: Well, let's talk about delivering next year. What expectations do you think you're going to have?\nIH: Yeah, I have no expectations at all because it's starting from scratch, everyone. So yeah, the work is going to be done. I'm just really looking forward to January, February, working with the team, getting to know all the people. Yeah. It's going to be crucial to try and be ahead a bit.\nQ: Final one from me: that world title showdown on Sunday. Who do you think is going to be champion?\nIH: Lando.\nQ: Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck this weekend. George, how are you and Mercedes viewing the season finale here in Abu Dhabi?\nGR: It's another race, to be honest. Obviously, we want to try and secure P2 in the Constructors’ Championship. It was a bit of a shame we couldn't achieve that in Qatar, but we have a very good shot this weekend and just go out and enjoy the last race of the season.\nQ: How competitive were you in Qatar, or was your performance masked by being in traffic?\nGR: I think, yeah, thanks to Isack, I had quite a long race in traffic. No, I think, unfortunately, we were very competitive. I think it was only really Oscar who was more competitive. I think, nine times out of ten when you are very competitive, the result is there. And I think, unfortunately, this was the one out of ten times when you do have the car, and unfortunately, it doesn't go the way you hope. And I think that lap seven Safety Car, starting on the inside – I think every driver in the first four rows who started on the inside lost at least one position – so that just compromised the whole weekend.\nQ: In terms of the Drivers’ Championship, you're going to finish fourth this season as you did in 2022. Which has been the better season for you, do you think? 2022 or 2025?\nGR: No, I think both seasons were very strong. I'd say this season, without doubt, has been my most competitive. I think 2022 was really challenging, experiencing porpoising for the first time and the challenges we were going through as a team and also my first year against Lewis. But I think, yeah, this has been a strong year.\nQ: Final one. World champion? Lando?\nGR: Lando.\nQUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR\nQ: (Craig Slater – Sky Sports) A question for George. You're going for Lando. Of course, it's very tight, and it's great that the world will be watching F1 this weekend. Is it a problem at all if it takes perhaps a team order to get Lando in a situation where he can win the championship? And what do you think is the kind of limit you could ask Oscar Piastri to do? Give up a second place potentially, if he’s a distant second and can’t win the champion to allow the team to win the championship?\nGR: I don't think it's acceptable or reasonable to ask a driver who's also in a shot of a championship in the very last race to move over for your team-mate. I think if it were, you know, in other seasons gone by – let's just say, you know, Checo and Max or Barrichello and Schumacher – when clearly one driver is the one going for the championship, and if in the last race, the guy who doesn't have a shot of winning the championship moves over, that is absolutely reasonable. And I think every single driver would do that. But for me, I don't think it would be fair at all. I think they both need to be given a shot. And if they lose out because of it, you just need to say the other guy did a better job, and that's racing. That's how it should be.\nQ: (Mara Sangiorgio – Sky Sport Italy) A question for all three. On paper, do you think you have the right car to play an important role on track in this title fight? Charles, let's start with you.\nCL: Well, I don't know how competitive we'll be this weekend. I think, at least for us, we expect McLaren to be extremely strong this weekend, then probably Red Bull, and then Mercedes and ourselves. Whether there will be at one point some interaction between the McLarens or the Red Bull and ourselves, I'm pretty sure there will be at one point. But I'm not here to think about any of that. I'll just do absolutely everything in order to maximise my race and then it’s up to them to the do the best job and try and get the championship, whoever the world champion will be, but that won’t be part of my thought process in my race for sure.\nQ: Isack?\nIH: I mean, I won't be racing any of these guys this weekend, to be honest. It's more like a traditional track. I think what Charles said about the ranking of the car performances makes sense. So we won't be there to disturb their fight, that's for sure.\nQ: George?\nGR: Well, I think McLaren have been so strong here the last few years. I think they were on pole and won the last couple of years, and it hasn't been our strongest track. But if we are in the mix, again, it's not really our problem. We're going out there to have the best race possible. I'm not going to risk any more or any less than any other race. For me, it's one race of 24. It's the last race of the season, but I treat every single one the same.\nQ: (Nelson Valkenburg – Viaplay) For Isack. You said, “I need to deliver,” that’s what Red Bull said to you. How can you deliver in a car that’s been historically difficult to deliver in alongside Verstappen? What’s the plan? What’s your mindset going to be racing alongside him, and what will you be satisfied with?\nIH: Well, it's not true. It’s not the same car at all next year. So that’s it. We're going to get the car we have. The team is going to build this car. I have to adapt to that car, and Max will have to do the same job. And if the car goes into one direction, at least I'll be there to feel the change. And ideally, I contribute to that change. So, you know, that would be the ideal scenario. And, you know, I've never repeated every year. I've always competed in different cars, so I don't know what it's like doing twice the same thing, the same job. So I think I'm pretty decent at adapting, so I'm actually confident.\nQ: (David Croft – Sky Sports F1) Another question for you, Isack. Congratulations on the new gig. I was talking to some of the engineers in Barcelona, your engineers at Racing Bulls, and they said that you were, in their opinion, the most similar driver to Max within that Red Bull driver stable. I don’t know if that’s something that you’ve analysed or thought of, but if that is the case, does it make this the obvious pairing to put you with Max? Because it is a new season, new regulations, so two drivers of the same style is surely better. And when did you find out that you got the gig? When was the date?\nIH: I can't tell you, but let's say I found out very late. Let's say, Qatar race week. And, I mean, if that’s the line-up for next year, then I think they chose it because it makes sense. And, of course, because it's a new regulation, so the timing is just very ideal for me. And then in terms of styles, I think obviously Max is very unique – he has a very unique style – and I would say myself as well. So I'm not obviously trying to copy what he's doing. But in terms of mindset, we have some things in common. But yeah, that's it.\nQ: (David Croft – Sky Sports F1) Can I just follow up – what would you say you have in common?\nIH: What I find very impressive with Max is that after four world championships, he's still very, very hungry and very mad when it doesn't go his way, because he always wants to win. And, you know, I don't think every champion can do that. Once you pass a certain level, you can maybe slow down a bit in your approach, but he seems to be starving, just like I am. So, it's very impressive.\nQ: (Kriya Gangiah – SuperSport South Africa) Joining Red Bull obviously marks a big step in your career. What excites you the most? And then, being from African descent, what does it feel like with the thoughts of a race probably coming to the continent?\nIH: Wait, what was the first part of the question?\nQ: (Kriya Gangiah – SuperSport South Africa) What excites you the most about this new chapter?\nIH: Honestly, there's two things – being in a world champion team. When I grew up watching Formula 1, I saw Vettel winning all these races, as a kid, with Red Bull. And being team-mates with Max, to see what it's like – what facing the best level in the world feels like. You know, it's definitely super-exciting. And a race in Africa is going to happen at some time. That’s for sure. It's going to take a moment, but it's going to happen.\nQ: (Stuart Codling – Autosport) Question for George. Ahead of the Qatar GP, there was a meeting between the GPDA and the FIA about the Driver Guidelines. The press release afterwards sort of suggested that you had all had a very nice chat, but nothing’s going to change. Could you say from your position as a director of the GPDA what the temperature is among the drivers, the level of satisfaction about that, and what opinions you had?\nGR: Well, I haven't seen the press release, so I can't comment on what was said there. I think it was agreed that nothing would change for the rest of this season, which I do think is correct. We've always asked for consistency, and it would be unfair to change that approach now. But I think the general consensus is always – guidelines need to be taken as guidelines. And we want the best Stewards, the best racing knowledge to judge certain incidents based upon their own experience. And I think that was clear when you put 20 F1 drivers in a room reviewing – I don't know how many we reviewed, six or seven incidents – we all agreed upon what the penalty should have been or not, regardless of what the guidelines said. So yeah, I hope there's a follow-up and look forward to hearing what they're thinking ahead of 2026.\nQ: (Niharika Ghorpade – Sportskeeda) To Charles and George: if on Sunday you are to factor into the championship, how are you going to go about it? Do you want to be a part of that mix at any point, or do you want to avoid it?\nCL: Well, I'd rather just win the race and have nothing to do with the way they fight for the championship. That's one way to look at it. But again, whether I'm fighting for second, third, fourth, or whichever position I find myself in, whoever is behind, I'll just fight him the same way just because I want to maximise that last race, and I'm fighting for my team. So again, there's nothing of that title battle that will cross my mind, because I just want to maximise my car potential. So yeah, I'll fight as hard for whoever is behind or in front and try to maximise our result.\nGR: Yeah. Exactly the same.\nQ: (Scott Mitchell-Malm – The Race) A question to George and to Charles. What do you think it is that your teams have missed the most versus Red Bull and McLaren in this rule set overall? And is there any question mark for you over whether or not your teams can definitely nail it next year if they didn't get on top of it in this rule set?\nGR: I think it's been an extremely challenging set of regs, to be honest. And obviously, this second half of the year, Red Bull have been on a very high level. But if I were to answer that question at the summer break, I would have argued that we were at a similar level to Red Bull. And if you compare that to ’23 – Aston Martin were ahead of ourselves and Ferrari and dropped off, McLaren were nowhere and obviously just found something pretty spectacular. So, I can't really answer that question – what it is we've missed. I think it's probably more where we started. I think we probably started in the wrong place and led ourselves down the wrong path and then had to revert. And clearly Red Bull, out of the blocks, had the least amount of porpoising in ’22 and almost had a six- or eight-month head start on everybody while we were trying to work that out. So, I don't think this regulation is really going to have any impact on the next set of regs, because the issues are going to be totally different.\nCL: I agree. I think for us there's not only one reason. There are many reasons which, at different times, played a role. In the beginning of ’22, we actually started off quite strongly, but we were struggling with porpoising, where Red Bull had a very stable platform. And they were actually quite a lot overweight, so as soon as they took off that weight, they were suddenly at the level where they've been since then. And then for last year, we focused very early on next year’s car, which I hope is a bet that will be a winning one. But for sure, it has some influence from the last two thirds of the season where we've been struggling more than others because we didn't bring that many upgrades. But in general, it's just been a generation of car that was very, very difficult to understand. And what worked back at the factory – I think everybody has been surprised once or more times that when you bring it on track, it doesn't correlate exactly to what you were expecting from that part. And that was the challenge of it. And yeah, and other teams did better, especially McLaren and Red Bull.\nQ: (Alejandro Alonso Lopez – Diario Motor.com) Question to Charles. It’s been overall a tough season, but as you said, it’s one to be proud of. What lessons are you taking on to next year from yourself as a driver that you will be able to apply going forward?\nCL: I think as a driver, obviously the first few years in F1, it was very clear what I had to work on because the weaknesses when you arrive in Formula 1 are much bigger. So it's very easy to target only one thing you want to improve, and that was race management and tyre management in my first few years. Then you improve those things, and then it's all about the details. And the experience you get in Formula 1 helps you to fine-tune the little things you want to get better at. So there's not one main lesson I will take from this year to next year – just many more little lessons that you keep in mind and try to fine-tune and get better at.\nQ: (Kumar Shyam Motwani – Al Ittihad) Question for Isack. You have competed on the Yas Marina Circuit during your junior days and with the Asian Championship. How do you think your track knowledge from your junior days will help you here when you're levelling up, especially when you want to finish the season with a flourish? Do you think it will be an advantage?\nIH: Yeah, I think Abu Dhabi is probably the track I've driven the most in my career. I’ve done, honestly, a lot of laps here. So, I think it's the only track probably on the calendar where I drove an F1 car before – apart from Mexico. So yeah, for once, I definitely feel like there's not a lot to learn. Sometimes I know a track really well, but I've only done it in lower categories, and the step to F1 is obviously huge. So, everything feels very different. But now, yeah, for sure it's going to help. But at the end of the day, it's three free practice sessions. You're going to reach the limits quite early in the weekend, and then it's all fine-tuning.\nQ: (Leonid Kliuev – Grande Premio Brazil) Question for all three. Kimi, of course, became a target of online abuse after Qatar. Did any of you have a chance to talk to Kimi, and how can we make sure it won't happen in the future? Thank you.\nGR: Yeah, I think it's pretty unacceptable what happened and what was written and the abuse online. Obviously, it all started with a mistake from the Red Bull guys, and of course, they apologised, and that's okay. People make a mistake, especially when you don't have the full facts. But I think those thousands of people behind their keyboards have no excuse and really need to take a hard look at themselves in the mirror and think why that is acceptable – not just for F1, but just society altogether. I just struggle to comprehend it, really. So that's all I can say.\nIH: I haven't spoken to Kimi, but it's just unfair, especially when you're giving your absolute maximum during your race to bring it home – I think it was fourth. You make a mistake, and then there are all these things said about you online. I think it's just very unfair because you give your absolute maximum, and then it seems like you did this mistake on purpose, which I think is very not nice. And yeah, people behind their keyboards, like George said, are just idiots. They all know nothing about racing – never drove ever in their life – so that's the only reason why they comment.\nCL: Yeah, I don't have much more to add apart from that. It's unacceptable. And obviously, those people face no consequence for their words and for their disrespect towards drivers. So yeah, it's not up to us to think about the consequences that they should endure, but it's a big shame because, as they said, we’re all here trying to do our absolute best. We've done racing since we were kids, dreaming of being in that position, and today we're doing absolutely everything in order to be at the limit. And sometimes mistakes happen. In that particular case, also, the hate was for absolutely nothing. So yeah, I mean, I didn’t speak with Kimi. The only thing that you can do in those kinds of moments is to ignore everything that is happening, but that’s obviously very hard – especially when you are... I remember my first or second year in F1, you kind of look sometimes on social media at what's being said around you, or at least that was the case for me, and that makes it even more difficult. So yeah, then I think with experience you kind of get used to it, but we shouldn’t really have to get used to this kind of behaviour, and I hope that one day it will be tackled properly.\nQ: (Diletta Colombo – AutoMoto.it) Question for Charles. You were talking before about the decision to stop the aerodynamic development of the car early on in the season. How much of a psychological burden was it for you to know that you'd be at a technical disadvantage as the season progressed?\nCL: Well, not so much because we were at a technical disadvantage from the first race. So, it's not like it changed massively our approach to the season. And we saw it relatively quickly that we wouldn't be fighting for the world title because McLaren was too strong, Red Bull was obviously starting to make big gains, it wasn't very much of a point to put all our resources into trying to take the third or second place – if everything was going super well – in the Constructors', at the cost of next year, whichever cost it may be. So yeah, it’s never something you want to do. I would have much preferred pushing the development the whole year to try and clinch that world title, 100%. But if you are in the position that we were in at the beginning of the year, I think it was kind of a no-brainer. So, I don’t regret it.\n1 / 6\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 04: Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Scuderia Ferrari speaks in the Drivers Press Conference during previews ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 04, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Clive Rose/Getty Images)\nPART TWO – Max VERSTAPPEN (Red Bull Racing), Lando NORRIS (McLaren), Oscar PIASTRI (McLaren)\nQ: We're joined by the title protagonists. One of these gentlemen will be the 2025 FIA Formula One World Champion come Sunday night. Let's kick things off with this. Tell us about your preparations and how you're going to approach the season finale. Lando, perhaps we could start with you.\nLando NORRIS: Sure. Same as every weekend. Nothing changed. Of course, just some reviews of last weekend, like the same after every weekend really—review what went on, what was clearly and obviously not good for us, some of the mistakes we’ve made, and also the less obvious things that we could improve on. But that’s normal post-race understandings and therefore preparations for the next race. But otherwise, nothing does change. I mean, it gets treated the same from everyone inside the team. Just more excitement, I guess, for everyone at the same time. But apart from that, the work and how you approach it all remains the same\nQ: Max, please.\nMax VERSTAPPEN: Spent some time with my daughter, figured some stuff out for GT3 for next year, figured out some stuff for my sim team as well, planning for next year. So, yeah, just pretty straightforward stuff before arriving here, to be honest.\nQ: Oscar?\nOscar PIASTRI: I mean, I wasn’t organising GT3 teams, but I played some padel, and just treated it like normal. Obviously, there’s not that many days in between. Had a marketing day, so that was good fun, and that’s been about it.\nQUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR\nQ: (David Croft – Sky Sports F1) Before I ask a question, to each and every one of you guys, best of luck for Sunday, and thank you for a great season. It's been an absolute pleasure to watch, and I speak on behalf of everybody for that. May the best driver win—but only one of you can. When you reflect on this year, to each one of you, what incidents will go down as they were the ones where the title got away? And we’ll start with the championship leader first, then Max, then Oscar.\nLN: I mean, there’s always little things along the way. Of course, there are probably some more obvious ones from my side. You know, if I go back to Canada, probably being the most like ‘just put my hands up in the air—I messed up’. It cost me a good amount of points. Yeah. China, I’ve been unlucky in qualifying. And then just some little things along the way. It's probably like that for everyone. There certainly is for everyone. Otherwise, there’s some other bits where, probably the same for all of us here, at times, you get a bit unlucky, whether it was the DNF in Zandvoort or the disqualification. That’s not unlucky. That’s just not doing a good enough job as a team. But the disqualification in Vegas as well cost me a good amount of points. So yeah, I wouldn’t say anything obvious. It was just a couple of parts from my side that I have to put my hands up and admit I didn’t do a very good job. And then a couple from us as a team where we have to admit we also didn’t do a good enough job, including last weekend. But that’s probably about it.\nMV: At the end of the day, of course, it’s one over 24 races. Some races go a bit better than others. A lot of the races we didn’t have a lot of pace or enough pace to challenge for a win, but here we are. So, in general, I’m just very proud of the season that we’ve done, how we've come back as well in the second half. So yeah, we’ll just try and keep it fun now ‘til the end. But yeah, to always pinpoint on one particular moment is a hard one.\nOP: Yeah, I mean, there are a few moments to choose from, I’d say, unfortunately. But I think for everyone, there’s always moments, and no season is ever going to be perfect. So, I think it's not particularly useful picking out “I lost this amount of points here, this amount of points there,\" because everyone’s lost a certain amount of points at some point along the way. But yeah, definitely on my side of things, there’s been a few races or a few moments I’d like to have again. Same thing as the team, I’m sure. But yeah, picking one—I don’t think there’s one that’s hurt more than others.\nQ: (Marina Becker – TV Bandeirantes) I know that you're trying—the three of you—to face this weekend as a normal weekend, but it’s not. I just wanted to know if your parents are here, and some friends, and did you allow them to come, or did you ask them to come?\nLN: A mix. I mean, it’s end of season. Every year I invite some of my friends because they’re just as important as the rest in terms of – a lot of my friends support me every weekend, support me every week, cheer for me. I always lean on my friends for advice and help in different moments. So yeah, win or lose, end of the season, it’s always nice to share it with them. But I do that every year, so it’s nothing special from that point of view. And my parents come to many races, and they’re here again because it’s the final one – not because of it being a good one or a bad one or whatever it may be. They come to the final race of the season every time. So, a little mix, but no, I want them to be there because it’s a moment again, win or lose, it’s a moment where I just want to share every bit that I can with my friends, with my family, because it’s also fun for them.\nMV: No. Parents are not here. My dad is rallying in Africa. And my mom… Yeah, I guess it was not planned. I also didn’t really plan to be in the title fight till the end. So, yeah, here we are. Yeah, I think after Zandvoort everything was a bit cancelled, I would say. My mom is at home happy with the dogs. So yeah. You can see a lot on TV anyway.\nOP: Yeah, my family is here. Kind of similar to Lando in some ways. It’s the last race. I’ve done a lot of racing without any of my family and friends in my career, so it is always nice to have them there. But it doesn’t change the world, let’s say. It is nice, obviously, but I know some people actually prefer it when their parents aren’t there or they don’t have people around. But for me, it is a nice thing.\nQ: (Tom Slafer – DAZN Spain) This week, everyone is giving their opinions on who they think will win the championship. I think we’ve been asking all the other drivers who they think will win the championship. So, let me ask you three: who do you think takes that trophy?\nLN: Well, everyone’s going to say each other, so...\nQ: (Nelson Valkenburg – Viaplay) For both Lando and Oscar, it’s been some time since you’ve changed engines, and we’ve seen some Mercedes engines go this year. Is this on your mind in any way, shape, or form for this weekend?\nOP: To be honest with you, I don’t even know which engine I’ve got in or when we changed it or whatever. So, no, I’m not concerned.\nLN: Same.\nQ: (Tim Hauraney – TSN) Question for Max. Max, I know you said your mom was at home looking after the dogs and your dad was off rallying, but did either of them give you any words of encouragement coming into this weekend at all?\nMV: We are not like that. They know that when I sit in the car, I will give everything I have. I just speak to them about other stuff. So, they don’t need to motivate me. That doesn’t really work like that. But of course, they always support me, you know? My mom always lights a candle before every race weekend. But yeah, I guess they trust their son.\nQ: (Rachel Brookes – Sky F1) Lando, is there a scenario where you’re in the final laps of the race and you’re running in P4 with Oscar in P3 and Max is leading? Oscar knew this was coming. I could see from the smile on your face. Is there a scenario where you would expect or even want him to make it easy for you to pass if he’s out of contention? And has that been discussed at all?\nLN: No. Not been discussed. And honestly, I mean, I would love it, but I don’t think I would ask it. Because… I don’t know, it’s up to Oscar if he would allow it, you know? I don’t think it’s necessarily down to me. It’s the same if it’s the other way around. Would I be willing to or not? Personally, I think I would just because I feel like I’m always like that, and that’s just how I am. But yeah, it’s not really up to me. I’m not going to ask it. I don’t want to ask it because I don’t think it’s necessarily a fair question. And at the same time, if that’s how it ends and Max wins, then well, that’s it. Congrats to him and I look forward to next year. It doesn’t change anything. It doesn’t change my life. So, he will deserve it over us.\nQ: Oscar, have you given that scenario any thought at all?\nOP: Rachel asked it to Lando! It’s not something we’ve discussed. So, yeah. I mean, until I know what’s kind of expected… I don’t really have an answer until I know what’s expected of me.\nQ: (Steve Crossman – BBC 5 Live) I just wanted to ask all of you really about teammates. So, for Lando and Oscar, it’d be interesting to hear what you guys like and admire about each other—whether that’s as drivers or as human beings. And if you wouldn’t mind, Max, off the bat—just curious to know what you think, especially because you’re going to get a new one—what makes for a good team-mate?\nLN: Umm….\nOP: Don’t rush into it!\nLN: Yeah, there’s just so many to choose from. I think what I like about him is just his general attitude of how he approaches everything. Always, I mean, I said it a few weeks ago, but just always pretty calm, pretty relaxed in every situation, stays cool. That’s something I admire and I think is something that at times I wish I was a little bit more like. But, you know, everyone does their own thing. You always try and find what works best for you. But there’s still things from every driver, even when I was growing up, that you admire in them, don’t like in them, whatever it may be, you know? But I think also the most important thing is just how you get on personally. I’ve always got on well with my team-mates. It’s easy not to. It takes one decision to make everything not be the way it is. And I think that’s something we’ve done well. It obviously makes our life hard as a team because we have two drivers fighting for a championship instead of one, and that also has its complications at times and its difficulties. Allows for other parties to enter the chat more often. But we’re still happy that we’re both up there. And I think how we’ve worked together, how we just treat each other, whether it’s on the track, off the track, whatever it may be, is just a good way of approaching everything, I think. Not everyone would agree with it, which is completely acceptable and understandable. But I think we both have a similar approach in terms of just wanting to go on track, prove who’s better, try and drive the quickest, but also come off and enjoy our life when the helmet’s off. When it’s just us as people, us as personalities. And I think that’s something that I have a lot of respect for, and I enjoy. I think I’ll look back on it in ten years’ time and say the same thing.\nOP: Yeah. I mean, his car collection. I’m trying to catch up! But no, honestly, similar things. Like, I think it’s nice that we’re able to leave what happens on track, on the track, and be friendly off the track. I think, like Lando said, it’s very easy for it to not be that way, and that definitely takes cooperation from both parties. So, yeah, I think for me, that’s probably what I…. I mean, ‘admire’ sounds a bit strong in teammates but I think that is a very good strength of Lando’s.\nMV: Yeah. Just the timing. You want me a long answer or not? I just—what you want from a teammate? Good in also developing the car with the team. Good understanding between the drivers. Friendly, funny, open-minded, not hiding things throughout the weekend between the two drivers. So, yeah, in general, just trying to push the team forward. I think that’s the most important. If you are good friends off track, that’s a nice bonus but not necessarily needed, as long as you are very professional on track and it benefits the team.\nQ: (Rodrigo França – Car Magazine Brazil) Question to Lando and Oscar. Max said his mother lights a candle before each race. So do your mothers have this kind of ritual, and do they tell you to be careful on the track, for example?\nOP: I don’t think my mom has any rituals, so to speak. Yes, she does tell me to be careful, and she normally likes it when there’s no other cars around me, which is understandable. I like that too. But apart from that, there’s nothing special. You know, obviously for my mom and, well, I mean, everyone that watches me race from Australia it’s pretty brutal at the best of times trying to stay up. So, there are a lot of sleepless nights for everyone, a lot of tough Monday mornings, regardless of what the result’s been. So, yeah, it’s always nice to have their support.\nLN: Similar. I mean, my mom does many things – different shoes, odd-coloured shoes, whatever, she does a lot of different stuff. She doesn’t, I think, do anything that I know of that’s like Max said. But yeah, she also tells me similar things: stay away from the others and be careful. I guess it’s just a different mentality. You know, like Max’s mom was a racing driver, so I think she understands probably more than our moms might do. So, I think they get maybe a bit more scared because they don’t understand everything that goes on quite as well. But yeah, I love my mom, so it’s good.\nQ: (Scott Mitchell-Malm – The Race) It’s a question to all three, starting with Max. In terms of dealing with the weight of the occasion—you’ve obviously been here and done it. And compared to 2021 in particular, how are you feeling about it in terms of tension or whatever? Because I think I remember in '21 you said you ended up driving with cramp during the Grand Prix because it was obviously so stressful. And then for the two McLaren drivers—how are you dealing with the pressure?\nMV: I’m very relaxed. Nothing to lose, you know? So, I’m just enjoying being here. But for me, it’s not even about being here. I’ve been enjoying the second half of the season, working with the team, how we’ve been able to turn it around from difficult times and really having a debrief after the race, being very disappointed and frustrated with the performances to just enjoying, smiling. Having these wins again is fantastic. So, I just take it – everything here is just a bonus, sitting here fighting for the title. So that’s also what makes it very straightforward for me. We will just try to have a good weekend. But then even then, it’s not really in my control, you know? So we just, yeah, like I said, try to enjoy it.\nLN: Similar. I know I’ve obviously not been in this situation before, so pretty different, I guess, for both of us. But at the minute, I feel good. Like, I really don’t think of it at all until you guys ask it all the time. So, it’s trying to avoid you guys as much as possible! But that’s also part of the job. So it’s nothing new. It’s nothing that shocks me. Whatever. I come into the weekend not thinking of it. For the last three days, just playing some golf and being with my mates and having a good time. And I look forward to doing that on Monday, whether I’m hungover or not. So, yeah, really it is the same, and I think it’ll be the same on track as how I’ve been the last few weeks. As much as there’s been pressure the last few weeks, I’ve still felt comfortable and I still feel good in the car. So, just yeah. All good.\nOP: Yeah, I’m relaxed. I’ve been on the opposite side of the championship battle in the junior categories, and I know what that felt and it was pretty tough. So, coming into it from, you know, the least to lose out of us three is quite different for me. And I think off the back of Qatar, I’ve got a lot of confidence that I can perform well. Obviously, I need a fair few things to happen this weekend to come out champion, but I’ll just make sure I’m in the right place at the right time and see what happens.\nQ: (Christian Menath – Motorsport-magazin.com) Question to the two McLaren drivers. What’s the situation regarding sharing data this weekend? Are you working together as teammates as all the other weekends before, or is there anything different this weekend?\nOP: We’ve set up a cardboard barrier between the two of us. No, it’s the same as usual. Obviously, we want to go out and make the car as quick as possible and win. We’ve always wanted the same opportunities to go out and win races. So that’s exactly the same this weekend.\nLN: Nothing more to add. I don’t think Zak or Andrea would let us even if we wanted to. So, no. It’s the same as every weekend.\nQ: (Phil Duncan – PA) Question for Lando. Max has been saying, you know, he has nothing to lose. Oscar just then said he has the least to lose. Do you feel like because you’re the leader, you have the most to lose? And what’s it like navigating that? And just one to Max—you’ve obviously been here before in ’21. Do you think that gives you an advantage because you’ve been here and done it?\nLN: I guess in terms of position, of course, I have the most to lose because I am the one at the top. Yeah. And I’ll do my best to stay there till the end of the year, a few more days. At the same time, if it doesn’t go my way, then I try again next year. It’ll hurt probably for a little while, but then, yeah, that’s life. I’ll crack on and try and do better next season. So, I also feel like I have the mentality of \"I have nothing to lose,\" because it’s just a race for a championship. But in 30 years’ time, I probably won’t think of it that much either way. So, I’m not too bothered. I’ll do the best I can. If it happens, great. If it doesn’t, then I’ll try again next year.\nMV: I mean, trophy looks the same. You know, I have four of those at home, so it’s nice to add a fifth. Yeah. I mean, I know my signature, so it’s the same. But yeah, I mean, of course you always try to win it. But at the same time, I’ve already achieved everything that I wanted to achieve in F1, and everything is just a bonus. And I just keep doing it because I love it and I enjoy it. And that’s also how I go into this weekend—have a good time out there, try to maximise the result. And even with that, maximising the result? I don’t even know what that means in terms of where you are in the ranking, you know? Because realistically, I don’t think we are the quickest. But you never know. A lot of things can happen—like it did also in Qatar. So we’ll just see.\nQ: (Radek Mazal – TV Nova) Question for Max. We've been talking about Lando's and Oscar's engines. But how about yours, Max? You used the fifth one—the new one—in São Paulo, but last race you used the fourth one again, the old one. So how is it going to be here in Abu Dhabi? Thank you.\nMV: Maybe use the fifth one… or the fourth. They all run. So, we'll see. It doesn't matter. I mean, they all work. So that's the most important.\nQ: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) A question for the two McLaren drivers. Max has said he’s already achieved everything he wants in F1 by becoming World Champion. But for the two of you, what would it mean to be lifting the trophy that's to your left at the World Championship Gala?\nLN: I don’t know. Ask me, hopefully, in a few days or a few weeks then. I think this has been my whole life. It's everything I've worked towards my whole life. So, it would mean the world to me. It would mean the world to everyone that’s supported me and pushed me for the last, what is it, like 16 years of my life in terms of trying to get to this point. So, it would mean everything. It would mean my life until now has been a success, and I’ve accomplished that dream I had when I was a kid. Other than that, I don’t know what else to say. It’s a reward for a lot of hard work that goes into things, and I think it goes to whoever deserves it the most.\nOP: I mean, it'd be pretty cool, to be honest. But I think it often takes a little while for those kinds of things to settle in. And at the same time, next season starts in a few weeks. So, I think regardless of whatever you've achieved in the past – Max is probably the most qualified to say this – but I think you move on pretty quick and try and win the next race that’s in front of you. So yeah, obviously it would be a very cool achievement. But I’m not getting my hopes up too high. We’ll see what happens. And yeah, if I can achieve it, then I’ll be a pretty happy guy.\nQ: (Ben Waterworth – Speedcafe) Question to Oscar. The last two times we’ve had a championship with two or more drivers, the driver in third actually did come home with the championship. Can you take much inspiration from Kimi and Seb? And you touched on the support from Australia – so much support back home, it even reached Parliament this week, the discussion around it. Are you feeling that at the moment from back home?\nOP: I did see it reach Parliament. Yeah, that’s quite impressive. Nice stat to have, given that I’m in that position. But just because history has gone that way once doesn’t mean it will again. So, I’m certainly not leaning on that, but maybe it gives me the tiniest amount of comfort that it is possible.\nAnd I think the support from back home has been really special. I obviously don’t see a huge amount of it. I’ve not being back to Australia since the Grand Prix but I think the fact that Formula 1 and regardless of why it was in Parliament, the fact that my name is in Parliament in Australia is pretty cool in some ways. A pretty cool thing. And I guess it signifies the magnitude of the support and the following that we've had back home. So that's very, very cool to see, and I’ll try my best to bring it home for everyone.\nQ: (Leonid Kliuev – Grande Premio Brazil) Question for Oscar. Your mentor, Mark [Webber], famously lost to Seb back in 2010 here. When you fight here, will it be partly a retribution, a gesture towards Mark?\nOP: No. I think for me, I'm trying to do it for myself. Ultimately, as racing drivers, we’re pretty selfish people most of the time. And ultimately, we’re the only ones in the car doing it for our own personal pride. Obviously, there are a lot of people along the journey – your family, your friends, managers, whoever it might be, people that supported you. But ultimately, you start out in this sport because you want to do it for yourself. So yeah, that’s first and foremost. I’m sure Mark would love to see me win, obviously. But yeah, there' are no kind of thoughts about paying that back or anything like that."}

Over at Red Bull, meanwhile, Yuki Tsunoda had handed his car over to Arvid Lindblad, the F2 racer who is set to join Racing Bulls on the grid in 2026 .\nIsack Hadjar – the man Lindblad will replace, with the Frenchman making the step up to Red Bull next season – led the pack out when first practice got underway at 1330 local time. It quickly proved to be a busy start, as all 20 cars hit the track within the opening minutes.\nThat traffic soon appeared to cause some frustration for Hadjar, the Racing Bulls driver waving his hand after approaching the Williams of Luke Browning ahead. As for Browning – who was making his fourth FP1 appearance – the British driver reported issues with his radio.\nThe other FW47 of Carlos Sainz had gone quickest a quarter of the way into the session, the Spaniard setting a lap of 1m 25.712s off the back of his second podium for the Grove-based outfit last time out in Qatar. Championship leader Norris, meanwhile, was just 0.052s behind.\nPractice 1 results\nFORMULA 1 ETIHAD AIRWAYS ABU DHABI GRAND PRIX 2025\nThat P1 did not last long for Sainz, with the times rapidly tumbling and the name at the top of the timesheets changing as FP1 progressed. Elsewhere there was a problem for Ollie Bearman, the Haas man reporting a loss of power before being informed by his race engineer of a “leak” in the car.\nThe Briton managed to limp back to the pits – just as Browning was able to return to action, having spent time in the garage while the team addressed his radio issues. As the hour reached its halfway point, Hadjar looked to have set the fastest time before it was bettered by his future team mate Verstappen, the Dutchman pumping in a 1m 24.493s after bolting on the soft tyres.\nGeorge Russell had also swapped to the C5 rubber and slotted into P2 behind Verstappen, the Mercedes driver’s effort putting him 0.240s behind the Red Bull. Kimi Antonelli then followed by going third quickest on a weekend where the Silver Arrows are hoping to seal second place in the Teams’ Championship.\nThere was a bit of a moment for Norris through Turn 2, the Briton experiencing a snap during his first flying run on the soft tyres – though the lap still proved to be enough to put him into second place behind Verstappen.\nElsewhere there was a close call for Aston Martin between their two rookie drivers, with Jak Crawford approaching Cian Shields whilst the former was on a hot lap. Over at Haas, Bearman’s earlier issue initially looked to have been fixed as he returned to action – but the youngster then reported that the problem seemed to be getting worse, resulting in the decision to retire for the car for the remainder of the session amid what the team later said was a sensor-related issue.\nAhead of the final 15 minutes, Norris sat at the top of the timesheets on a 1m 24.485s – a mere 0.008s clear of Verstappen – before the last laps started to go on the board. Charles Leclerc had slotted into third, while his younger brother Arthur – in the other Ferrari – was in 18th place.\nVerstappen reported that there “might be something broken” on his RB21, an issue that he suggested was “everywhere” on the car, though the World Champion was still running on track. Charles Leclerc, meanwhile, suffered a spin at Turn 5, prompting his sibling to joke that the elder Leclerc was “doing some burnouts” for the watching fans.\nAs the clock ticked down, Norris held onto the P1 slot thanks to his earlier effort, with Verstappen and Charles Leclerc remaining in second and third respectively. Antonelli and Russell were fourth and sixth, while Kick Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg separated the Mercedes pair in fifth.\nHulkenberg’s team mate Gabriel Bortoleto followed in P7, with Bearman, Sainz and the Alpine of Franco Colapinto rounding out the top 10. Ryo Hirakawa in the Haas claimed P11, leading Hadjar, Alpine’s Paul Aron, O’Ward and Lindblad. Completing the classification were Arthur Leclerc, Ayumu Iwasa for Racing Bulls, Browning, Crawford and Shields.\nWith the first hour of running now complete, the drivers and teams will examine their data and prepare for Friday’s more representative second practice session, which is set to get underway at 1700 local time."}

I almost crashed,” Norris complained afterwards. However, while the stewards noted the incident and took a closer look at it, they ultimately decided against any further action, meaning no risk of a penalty being applied.\nAs the session reached its one-quarter mark, it was Racing Bulls rookie – and 2026 Red Bull racer – Isack Hadjar who led the way thanks to a 1m 24.167s on softs, marginally quicker than Haas’ Ollie Bearman (also softs) and Norris, Verstappen and Piastri (mediums).\nNot long after, Verstappen made the switch to the soft rubber and lowered the benchmark to a 1m 23.446s, only for Norris to produce a 1m 23.083s and move comfortably clear when he bolted on the red-marked compound.\nAttention then turned to what Piastri could do on his first Qualifying-style simulation, but a low-key lap left him down in 10th, behind both Mercedes cars, both Kick Saubers, Bearman’s Haas, Hadjar’s Racing Bulls and Charles Leclerc’s Ferrari.\nMeanwhile, there were problems for Williams to contend with in the form of a dramatic snap for Carlos Sainz through the high-speed Turn 2/3 sweeps, which the Spaniard did well to save and move on from, and apparent engine woes for Alex Albon.\nOnce those Qualifying laps were out of the way, drivers moved their focus to longer runs to gather some valuable data for Sunday evening’s race, meaning Norris’ aforementioned 1m 23s effort remained the P1 time over Verstappen (who reported more bouncing late on) and Russell at the chequered flag.\nBearman ended up a high-flying fourth for Haas, edging out the similarly impressive Saubers of Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto. “Mate, the car is insane! I don’t know how it’s so good,” the British rookie commented over the radio mid-session.\nHadjar was another youngster to enjoy a strong start to the weekend in seventh, ahead of Leclerc, Aston Martin driver Fernando Alonso and the other Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli, leaving Piastri just outside the top-10 positions.\nLance Stroll followed team mate Alonso in 12th, from Williams pair Sainz and Albon, who sandwiched Lewis Hamilton’s Ferrari, the Haas of Esteban Ocon, outgoing Red Bull racer Yuki Tsunoda, Liam Lawson’s Racing Bulls and the Alpines.\nDrivers and teams will now regroup in the Yas Marina paddock to dig through the data and ponder any set-up changes before Saturday’s third and final practice session, which is set to begin at 1430 local time."}

Norris then had a near-miss with Yuki Tsunoda, who failed to pull aside and let the McLaren past, forcing him into evasive action – the outgoing Red Bull driver raised his hand in apology and was later noted for impeding.\nAs the circuit gradually got busier, Ollie Bearman quickly proved that his pace in FP2 wasn’t a fluke as his first lap was just 0.008s slower than Norris’ effort, before Verstappen stormed to P1 just before the halfway point. The Haas wasn't the only surprise at the front, with Stroll demoting him to second following a rapid lap on the red-walled soft tyres.\nThe laps were coming in thick and fast with everyone making the most of the final opportunity to prepare for Qualifying, but Lewis Hamilton found the limit at Turn 9 as he suffered a high speed spin and went careering into the barrier. He was fortunately uninjured, reporting: “Something buckled at the front and snapped the rear.”\nThe remaining drivers lost valuable time as they returned to the pits while his damaged Ferrari was recovered, leaving them keen to make the most of the final quarter of the session once the pit exit reopened.\nPiastri was the first to do so, jumping from P18 to P1 to go half a second clear of Verstappen on a fresh set of tyres. He didn't stay on top for long as Norris, also on new tyres, set a 1m 23.338s to reclaim first position – his final sector alone was three tenths faster than his team mate.\nThe drama wasn’t just confined to the track as Mercedes youngster Kimi Antonelli was released straight into Tsunoda’s path in the pitlane, crashing into the side of the Red Bull and damaging his own front wing in the process.\nHis team mate Russell then charged to P1 in the last few minutes of FP3, with Alonso taking a high-flying fourth place behind Norris and Verstappen, with the lead Red Bull just over a tenth away from Russell's pace-setting lap.\nPiastri ended down in fifth ahead of the impressive Haas duo of Esteban Ocon and Bearman. Charles Leclerc, Antonelli and Alex Albon rounded out the top 10 in an eventful session where just 0.388s covered the front half of the field.\nThe drivers and teams now have just over a couple of hours to regroup before Qualifying gets underway at 1800 local time."}

Comedian Jack Whitehall hosted proceedings, and there were also performances from musical guests including Kane Brown and Take That.\nNorris victorious before Piastri takes momentum\nThe Australian Grand Prix was the first race of a 24-round calendar and it proved to be a chaotic affair, with Lando Norris emerging as the winner following an event that featured changing weather conditions, Safety Cars and numerous crashes.\nTeam mate Oscar Piastri was amongst those to slide off track – but the Australian bounced back with victory in China one week later, kickstarting an early run of momentum that would see the 24-year-old take the championship lead at Round 5 in Saudi Arabia.\nFerrari go from Sprint win to double DSQ\nSpeaking of China, Round 2 of the championship proved to be one of highs and lows for Ferrari . Hamilton returned to winning ways in the first Sprint of the campaign, converting pole position into P1 as the Briton gave the Scuderia’s fans something to smile about.\nHowever, Sunday’s race proved to be much tougher. Charles Leclerc and Hamilton initially crossed the line in fifth and sixth respectively – but both were later disqualified , with the former’s car found to be underweight in post-race checks while the rear skid block on Hamilton’s SF-25 was found to be under the minimum thickness required in the technical regulations.\nLawson and Tsunoda swap seats\nAfter being promoted to Red Bull from the team’s sister squad for 2025, Liam Lawson faced a tricky start during the first two rounds of the campaign, recording a DNF in Australia before finishing outside of the points in China.\nIt was subsequently announced that the New Zealander would return to Racing Bulls as of Round 3 in Japan, marking a direct swap with Yuki Tsunoda as the Japanese racer became the latest to step up as Max Verstappen ’s team mate.\nDoohan replaced, Colapinto returns and Oakes leaves Alpine\nAnother driver change took place at Alpine in May. Speculation had long been swirling over Jack Doohan’s position at the team – and it was confirmed in the days after the Miami Grand Prix that he would be replaced by Franco Colapinto going forwards, with the Australian becoming first-choice reserve.\nThis was just one personnel change at the Enstone-based squad within a short space of time; it was announced only one day earlier that Team Principal Oliver Oakes had resigned with immediate effect.\nMcLaren come to blows in Canada as Russell wins and Antonelli scores a podium\nAmid a dominant showing from McLaren during the early stages of the season – with Piastri and Norris responsible for seven wins in nine races, the other two victories belonging to Verstappen – Norris admitted that it was perhaps only a matter of time until he and his team mate came to blows on track.\nSuch an incident finally occurred at Round 10 in Canada. As they battled for P4 in the closing stages, Norris made contact with Piastri and suffered race-ending damage to his car, with the Briton later taking responsibility for what happened. George Russell , meanwhile, claimed a debut win of the season for Mercedes , while rookie team mate Kimi Antonelli scored his first F1 podium in third.\nF1 The Movie is released\nFormula 1 arrived on the big screen in June as F1 The Movie was released in cinemas. Filming of the motion picture – starring Brad Pitt as former driver Sonny Hayes, who makes a comeback to partner rookie Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris) at the fictional APXGP team – took place during actual Grand Prix weekends throughout the 2023 and 2024 seasons.\nThe drivers and teams got a first glimpse of the movie after attending a private screening in Monaco a few weeks earlier, with many voicing their approval of the film afterwards .\nNorris wins at home while Hulkenberg takes first podium\nIn terms of feel-good moments of the season, the British Grand Prix certainly provided some standout memories. After winning in Monaco for the first time earlier in the campaign, Norris added another iconic victory to his list by triumphing in front of his home crowd at Silverstone for the first time.\nJoining him on the podium was Nico Hulkenberg , the Kick Sauber driver finally achieving a maiden top-three finish on his 239th attempt. It was a hugely popular result and one that the German hailed as “quite incredible” .\nHorner leaves Red Bull\nJust days after F1’s visit to Silverstone, Red Bull announced that Team Principal and CEO Christian Horner would leave the team with immediate effect , bringing a sudden end to his long period in charge of the outfit.\nWith Horner exiting after some 20 years in the role, Racing Bulls’ Laurent Mekies made the step up to replace him, while Alan Permane moved from Racing Director to Team Principal at the sister outfit as part of the reshuffle.\nVerstappen linked to Mercedes move\nAnother off-track matter involving Red Bull that led to much discussion during the first half of the season was the topic of Verstappen’s future. Despite holding a contract to race for the Milton Keynes-based team until the end of 2028, speculation mounted linking the Dutchman to a Mercedes switch.\nThe rumours were put to bed when Verstappen confirmed just before the Hungarian Grand Prix that he would stay with the squad into 2026 , while the Silver Arrows’ line-up was made official in October as it was announced that Russell and Antonelli would remain with the team.\nPiastri leads as Red Bull struggle at halfway point\nAfter an eventful first half of the campaign, Piastri had maintained his championship lead over Norris when F1 entered into its summer break following Round 14 at the Hungaroring, the Australian holding a nine-point margin over his team mate.\nRed Bull, however, were at something of a low point going into the break. A difficult outing in Hungary had seen Verstappen finish down in ninth, meaning that the Dutchman was now 97 points adrift of Piastri in the drivers’ standings.\nCadillac announce drivers for debut season\nWhile the remainder of 2025 was still to play out, a significant development for 2026 occurred when Cadillac – the 11th team set to join the grid next season – announced their driver line-up for their debut.\nValtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez were confirmed to make their returns to the grid with the American outfit, both bringing a vast amount of experience to the new operation.\nNorris retires at Zandvoort as Hadjar gets maiden podium\nWhen the campaign resumed at Zandvoort, Norris’ title hopes looked to have taken a blow as smoke started to emerge from his MCL39 in the final laps, forcing the Briton to pull off track and retire from the race. With Piastri taking victory, the points margin had now opened up to 34 points.\nWhile Norris faced heartbreak, it proved to be a much happier day for Isack Hadjar , the rookie scoring his debut F1 podium by crossing the line in third place for Racing Bulls.\nVerstappen’s comeback begins\nFollowing the Dutch Grand Prix, Verstappen had found himself 104 points adrift of Piastri in the Drivers’ Championship – but the four-time World Champion was not deterred, soon kickstarting a remarkable resurgence during the second half of the season.\nThis began with a victory one week later at Monza, the Red Bull man beating the McLaren duo to win with an impressive margin of 19 seconds.\nPiastri has a nightmare as Sainz returns to the podium\nJust as Verstappen looked to be on the up, a more challenging sequence started to unfold for Piastri at Round 17 in Azerbaijan. The championship leader hit the barriers during an eventful Qualifying before crashing out on Lap 1 of Sunday’s race, marking his first DNF of the campaign.\nIt was a better weekend for Carlos Sainz , however. The Williams driver looked to have put a challenging start to his first season with the team behind him, recording the second fastest time in Qualifying and claiming a maiden podium for the Grove-based outfit in Sunday’s race.\nAntonelli bounces back after Wolff’s comments\nAnother driver to have experienced mixed fortunes during the campaign so far was Antonelli, with the rookie enjoying a decent start to his maiden F1 season – which included a Sprint pole in Miami – before running into a difficult spell through the European leg.\nThe Italian’s performance in Monza was labelled as “underwhelming” by Mercedes boss Toto Wolff – but he promptly delivered a much more promising P4 in Baku, leading to a stronger second half of the year for the youngster.\nMcLaren secure back-to-back Teams’ Championships\nThe chances of McLaren clinching a second consecutive Teams’ Championship had long seemed likely, with the papaya squad building a sizeable points advantage over their rivals as the campaign progressed.\nWhile Russell was the race winner at Round 18 in Singapore, a P3 and P4 for Norris and Piastri respectively was enough to secure the crown for the Woking-based outfit , their first back-to-back teams’ titles since their run of four between 1988 and 1991.\nNorris retakes the lead\nAs Piastri’s spell off the podium continued, Norris was having a better run of form during the latter stages of the campaign. While both drivers were eliminated in a Lap 1 melee in the Austin Sprint – and lost out to Verstappen in Sunday’s race – Norris put himself ahead via a dominant performance in Mexico.\nConverting pole position into a commanding win – crossing the line with a whopping margin of 30 seconds over closest challenger Leclerc – Norris retook the championship lead from his team mate with four rounds still to go.\nVerstappen goes from pit lane to podium\nWhile Verstappen had continued to eat into his own points deficit in the standings – leading many to question if a fifth title could now be on the cards for the Dutchman – his charge looked to have hit a snag when he made a surprise Q1 exit in Qualifying for the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.\nAfter starting the race from the pit lane, Verstappen had his work cut out on Sunday at Interlagos – but the World Champion put in a stunning drive to climb right up to third place , ensuring that he was still very much in the fight prior to the final three races of the season.\nMcLaren suffer a double DSQ\nVerstappen returned to the top step with another win in Las Vegas, while Norris and Piastri initially finished second and fourth respectively. However, it was announced after the race that both McLaren cars had been disqualified due to the rearmost skid wear being found to be below the minimum 9mm thickness required in the technical regulations.\nThe result had quite an effect on the Drivers’ Championship, with it meaning that Verstappen was now equal with Piastri as both sat 24 points behind Norris entering into the last two rounds.\nNewey prepares for Team Principal role\nPrior to the penultimate event of the season in Qatar, Aston Martin announced a leadership reshuffle for 2026 that would see Adrian Newey – who had joined as Managing Technical Partner in March – take on the additional role of Team Principal .\nAndy Cowell – who had previously held the position of Team Principal and CEO – will become Chief Strategy Officer, with the team stating that the change is designed to focus on Newey and Cowell's \"individual strengths and expertise, ensuring organisational efficiency\".\nFerrari slip backwards in Teams’ Championship\nFor some time earlier in the season, Ferrari had held P2 in the Teams’ Championship. The Scuderia subsequently lost this to Mercedes after Round 17 in Azerbaijan, before retaking the position in Mexico thanks to a P2 finish for Leclerc.\nThings seemed to quickly unravel during the final races, however. A double DNF in Sao Paulo saw the team slip back to fourth in the standings, a position that they were confirmed in prior to the finale in Abu Dhabi. Post-Qatar, a disappointed Leclerc said that he had “no words” after the squad had again struggled for performance.\nRed Bull 2026 drivers confirmed\nThe final pieces of the 2026 driver line-up puzzle fell into place just a few days before the last race of 2025, with Red Bull announcing that Hadjar would replace Tsunoda at the squad as Verstappen’s team mate next year.\nTsunoda will take the role of test and reserve driver for both Red Bull and Racing Bulls, while the sister squad have recruited rookie Arvid Lindblad to fill Hadjar’s vacancy, the youngster making the step up from F2 to partner the incumbent Lawson.\nA three-way title decider in Abu Dhabi\nFor the first time in 15 years, three drivers arrived at the finale with a chance to win the World Championship; Norris led the standings by 12 points from Verstappen, with Piastri 16 points adrift in third.\nWhile a podium would be enough for Norris to seal the title, the Briton slipped to third on the opening lap and faced pressure from Leclerc, as well as a tense fight with Tsunoda later on. But the McLaren driver ultimately managed to hold on to that crucial P3, finishing behind Verstappen and Piastri to memorably clinch his maiden World Championship by two points."}

But most importantly, Lindblad has impressed members of the Red Bull hierarchy, including Laurent Mekies and Helmut Marko.\nAfter several Testing of Previous Car (TPC) runs this year – as well as two FP1 appearances for Red Bull at Silverstone and Mexico City – Lindblad has now been given his chance to race in the top echelon. Here is everything you need to know about the young British talent…\nMotorsport family and karting\nBorn to a Swedish father, an Indian mother, and into a motorsport-loving family, Lindblad grew up in Surrey, England, but he started on two wheels rather than four. Lindblad’s father had been a motocross rider and at three-years-old, bought his son a bike.\nBut with his mother wanting him to have a good life balance, ruling that school was a non-negotiable and Lindblad preferring four-wheel racing, they switched to karting at five with his first karting venture at Surrey’s Daytona Sandown Park circuit.\n1 / 2\nLindblad impressed during his rookie F3 campaign, finishing the season fourth in the standings\nHe won several competitions both in the UK and in Europe, including the 2018 British Karting Championship, which he claimed driving for Oliver Rowland Motorsport. The current Formula E driver and Lindblad met when he was seven and, since then, the former Renault and Williams Development Driver has served as a mentor.\nLindblad’s most successful year in karting came in 2021, when he joined the likes of Charles Leclerc and Kimi Antonelli in winning the WSK Euro Series, before coming out on top of the WSK Final Cup. This was in his first year as part of the Red Bull Junior programme, having signed to them at the 2020 Portuguese Grand Prix, aged just 13.\nSwitch to single-seaters\nThe Briton’s first full single-seater season started with the 2023 Italian F4 Championship where, helped by his six victories, he finished third in the standings.\nLindblad also finished fourth in the Euro 4 Championship and fifth in Formula 4 UAE, and later that year, he won the F4 race around the famous streets of Macau.\nIn 2024, Lindblad stepped up to Formula 3 with PREMA Racing, becoming the youngest winner in the championship’s history at 16-years-old when he won the Bahrain Sprint Race on his debut. He finished the year with four victories, which included a historic double at Silverstone – where he became the first driver ever to win every race on a single F3 weekend.\n1 / 2\nGraduating to F2 in 2025, Lindblad has already won twice and will make his F1 debut this weekend at Silverstone\nLindblad went into the final round at Monza as the only rookie in with a chance of claiming the title, before eventually finishing fourth in the standings.\nCurrently, Lindblad is in the midst of his debut Formula 2 season with Campos Racing, and so far, the Red Bull talent has shone. Until his retirement at Round 7’s Sprint Race in Austria, the rookie had finished every race in the top 10.\nHe has also won two races – the Jeddah Sprint and the Barcelona Feature – and is currently sixth in the standings with 79 points, trailing leader Richard Verschoor by 35 points with half the season remaining.\nHow good is Lindblad?\nLindblad’s speed is clear, but his work ethic and ability to adapt has been eye-catching. Jumping up from F4 to F3 is not easy, but his adaptability impressed many, especially PREMA Team Principal Rene Rosin, who said after Silverstone last year he had not expected it.\nThat trend has continued in F2, and current Team Principal Adrián Campos Jr explained in Austria why he thinks this is the case.\n“Arvid is a very strong driver,” said Campos Jr. “When you speak with him you don’t notice he is 17-years-old. That’s his strongest point, he is really mature. It’s like speaking with an old guy who has a 17-year-old body.”\nThat maturity was also been acknowledged by the FIA World Motor Sport Council, who granted Lindblad a Super license before his 18th birthday – as they did for Mercedes' Antonelli last year. As the FIA International Sporting Code states: “At the sole discretion of the FIA, a driver judged to have recently and consistently demonstrated outstanding ability and maturity in single-seater formula car competition may be granted a Super Licence at the age of 17-years-old.”\nFrom there, Lindblad went on to participate in Free Practice 1 sessions for Red Bull, recording 22 laps in his first outing at Silverstone before logging further mileage in Mexico City, where he also ranked an impressive P6 on the timesheets.\nThis has all marked what has been a rapid rise for Lindblad, as in two years he has gone from F4 to the pinnacle of the sport – and now his ascent continues, as he prepares for his full-time F1 debut with Racing Bulls."}

The move was an inspired one ; the FW15C proved to be a dominant force and took Prost to a historic fourth championship.\nThis would ultimately be the final act of the French driver’s time in Formula 1, bringing the curtain down on an illustrious career.\nNico Hulkenberg\nIn terms of making the most of every opportunity after losing a seat, Nico Hulkenberg is a glowing example.\nAt the end of 2019 – his ninth season in F1 – the experienced Hulkenberg found himself out of a job when he was dropped by Renault, who would instead bring in Esteban Ocon (another name to appear later) in 2020.\nIt transpired that it would not be long until the German appeared on the grid again, however. Amid a shortened season in 2020 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, Hulkenberg made two eye-catching substitute appearances for Racing Point when Sergio Perez and Lance Stroll each contracted the virus.\nWhen the team became known as Aston Martin in 2021, the super-sub was kept on as a reserve driver – and while his services were not required during that year, he again stepped in for two races in 2022 in place of Sebastian Vettel , who had tested positive for COVID-19.\nAll of this was enough to keep Hulkenberg on the radar of the teams, and he was subsequently signed up by Haas to make his full-time comeback in 2023. The 38-year-old has since gone from strength to strength, with his 2025 switch to Kick Sauber – soon to be known as Audi – delivering a long-awaited maiden podium at Silverstone.\nMika Salo\nLong before the era of ‘Hulkenback’, another driver to make the most of being a stand-in was Mika Salo.\nAfter making his debut for Lotus at the end of the 1994 season, Salo went on to race for Tyrrell and Arrows in the years that followed before the latter opted to change their line-up for 1999, leaving the Finn without a seat.\nWhen BAR’s Ricardo Zonta was sidelined with an injury, Salo stepped in across three races – and an even bigger call-up followed after Michael Schumacher broke his leg in a crash at the British Grand Prix, with Ferrari bringing Salo in to replace the German from the next round onwards in Austria.\nEddie Irvine was now heading the Scuderia’s charge as he battled McLaren’s Mika Hakkinen for the World Championship and, when Salo found himself in the lead of the German Grand Prix – in only his second outing for the team – the sub moved aside for Irvine. His P2 finish still marked his maiden podium in F1.\nAnother rostrum followed in front of the squad’s home crowd at Monza and, while Irvine just missed out on the Drivers’ crown , Salo’s contributions helped Ferrari to seal the Teams’ Championship. This also put the Finnish racer in the shop window and led to a full-time comeback in 2000 with Sauber.\nValtteri Bottas\nFast-forward to the modern era, and Salo’s fellow Finn Valtteri Bottas has also fashioned a return to the grid after previously finding himself without a seat.\nFollowing a four-year stint with Williams, Bottas joined Mercedes in 2017 following the sudden retirement of Nico Rosberg and went on to become a 10-time race winner in his five seasons with the squad.\nAfter being replaced by George Russell for 2022, the now 36-year-old raced for the Alfa Romeo/Kick Sauber outfit across the next three campaigns before losing his place at the future Audi outfit at the end of 2024.\nThis saw Bottas return to the Mercedes fold as a reserve driver, meaning that he remained a visible presence in the paddock whilst keeping an eye out for opportunities to return, having stated that he was “not done” with Formula 1 yet following his last race for Kick Sauber.\nIt was later confirmed in the summer of 2025 that Bottas will be back in 2026 as part of Cadillac ’s line-up for their maiden campaign in F1, where he will form an experienced pairing with Sergio Perez. Speaking of…\nSergio Perez\nThe Cadillac line-up will feature not one but two comeback drivers, as Perez joins Bottas for the American outfit’s debut.\nPerez enjoyed a long F1 career that started back in 2011 with Sauber, going on to drive for McLaren and Force India – and scoring his first-ever victory with the latter in 2020 – before replacing Alex Albon at Red Bull in 2021.\nThe collaboration was initially a successful one as Perez partnered with Max Verstappen, helping the outfit to clinch the Teams’ Championship in 2022 and 2023 as well as collecting a further five Grand Prix wins.\nA good start to 2024 resulted in the Mexican being handed a contract extension through to the end of 2026 – but the rest of his season unravelled, leading to Perez and Red Bull parting ways at the close of the campaign.\nWhile the 35-year-old opted to take a breather from the sport and spend time with his family in 2025, his desire to return to the grid remained and he will now embark on his 15th season in the sport with the Cadillac team in 2026.\nFelipe Massa\nLike Perez, Felipe Massa became a veteran of the sport across 15 campaigns – but it is perhaps easy to forget that his F1 career hit an early obstacle when he lost his seat following his rookie year.\nOff the back of winning the Euro Formula 3000 Championship in 2001, Massa made the step up to Formula 1 with Sauber in 2002 and scored points on three occasions. It was ultimately decided that he would be replaced in 2003, however, by Heinz-Harald Frentzen, with the Brazilian instead taking up a test driver role for Ferrari.\nFollowing a year on the sidelines, Massa bounced back by rejoining Sauber in 2004. His next season at the squad in 2005 saw him outscore new team mate Jacques Villeneuve , and the youngster impressed enough to earn a seat at Ferrari in 2006 alongside Michael Schumacher.\nFrom there the driver from Sao Paulo experienced plenty of success in the years that followed, collecting a total of 11 wins and 15 pole positions with the Scuderia before moving to Williams in 2014.\nWhile he had announced that he would retire at the end of 2016, Massa later stayed on for an additional year following Valtteri Bottas’ exit to Mercedes after the retirement of Nico Rosberg, bringing the Brazilian’s total number of Grands Prix up to 269.\nEsteban Ocon\nSeveral drivers in this list have found their opportunity to return to the grid following a year spent in a reserve role – and Esteban Ocon is another name to add to that group.\nHaving joined the Mercedes Junior Team in 2015, Ocon soon found his way to Formula 1 after replacing Ryo Haryanto at the Manor outfit midway through 2016, before going on to join Force India to begin his first full-time campaign in 2017.\nThe Frenchman’s promising ascent would soon come to a halt, however. After the team’s financial troubles in 2018 saw them purchased by a consortium of investors led by Lawrence Stroll, Ocon was replaced at the end of the season by Lance Stroll.\nFinding himself without a seat for 2019, the now 29-year-old took on a reserve driver position at Mercedes, embedding himself within the championship-winning squad whilst keen to get back on the grid in 2020, having said at the time : “I think in one year, the changes are not massive. If you miss two years, it’s a big step.”\nOcon ultimately got his wish as, after just the one year away, he secured a race seat with Renault, going on to score his maiden F1 victory with the team – now known as Alpine – in 2021 as well as making three additional visits to the podium in the seasons that followed. The French racer has since joined Haas, for whom he’ll embark on a second campaign in 2026.\nRomain Grosjean\nRemember what Ocon said about the potential challenge of making a comeback following more than a year away? This may be something Romain Grosjean would have something to say about, having made his own return following a 24-month gap.\nWhen Renault dropped Nelson Piquet Jr with seven rounds to spare in 2009, the outfit called up reserve Grosjean to replace him for the rest of the season. The Frenchman struggled to match new team mate Fernando Alonso during his debut appearance, finishing the race at Valencia down in 15th.\nAfter ending his brief stint with no points, Grosjean was not retained by Renault for 2010 and switched focus to other categories of motorsport. This also saw him return to Formula 2 – then known as GP2 – where he won the 2011 championship.\nIt was also during this year that Grosjean participated in two FP1 outings for Renault, and his full-time comeback followed for the newly-rebranded Lotus squad in 2012. The driver from Geneva collected 10 podiums across his four seasons with the team, including a career-best P2 finish at the 2013 United States Grand Prix.\nGrosjean then switched to Haas in 2016, where he remained until the end of 2020. And while his last F1 appearance saw him experience a shocking fiery crash in Bahrain, the Frenchman recently enjoyed an emotional one-off return at the wheel of his former team’s challenger during a 2025 Testing of Previous Car (TPC) event.\nKevin Magnussen\nOne of Grosjean’s team mates during his time in F1 was Kevin Magnussen , a man who made not one but two comebacks in his career.\nA former member of the McLaren Young Driver Programme, Magnussen was handed his Formula 1 debut in 2014 as he stepped up at the Woking-based outfit to replace the ousted Sergio Perez. Things could barely have gone better in his maiden race, with a second place making him one of the few drivers to take a podium in their first Grand Prix .\nWhile he scored points on 11 further occasions, it was not enough to keep Magnussen in the seat for 2015 and he was demoted to a test and reserve role. The Dane did not stay away for long, however, and returned to the grid with Renault in 2016.\nMagnussen went on to race for Haas between 2017 and 2020, but was left without a seat for 2021 when the American outfit opted for the all-new line-up of Nikita Mazepin and Mick Schumacher. The Danish driver’s attentions then switched to other categories – until a late call-up to rejoin the team came just weeks before the 2022 season following the exit of Mazepin.\nA lack of preparation time did not prevent Magnussen from impressing on his return, scoring points with a P5 finish in his first race back while another highlight came later in the year when he clinched a surprise pole position in Sao Paulo. The 33-year-old’s second stint with Haas subsequently came to an end at the close of 2024, meaning that his focus has returned to competing in the likes of the World Endurance Championship ."}

Here are our 2025 award ‘winners’…\nUnluckiest driver – Fernando Alonso\nAs Fernando Alonso crossed the line 11th in Imola he declared on the team radio that, “we are so unlucky, everything is wrong for us this year.”\nIt’s hard to argue with that. The two-time World Champion had to wait until the ninth round in Barcelona to score his first points of the season with a DNF in Australia, a brake failure in China, and a PU issue in Monaco all contributing to that streak of misfortune.\nWhat prompted that exclamation in Imola was the unfortunate timing of a VSC, allowing Alonso’s rivals a cheap pit stop, and he had a similar issue with the timing of a Safety Car in Zandvoort. There was also his suspension failure in Monza, which was caused – of all things – by a bit of gravel that had been thrown up by Norris ahead.\nStill, Alonso was never going to give up without a fight this year and managed to still make it back into the top 10 of the Drivers’ Championship – 16 points scored in the final two weekends certainly helped with that.\nFunniest moment – The LEGO race\nThe Miami Grand Prix drivers’ parade came with a twist this year as the grid were given the chance to get behind the wheel of fully drivable LEGO big build cars.\nEach team had a bespoke car in their own colours, which had been created by a skilled team of 26 designers, engineers and LEGO builders, over 22,000 hours. Every car was made up of nearly 400,000 LEGO bricks and was capable of reaching speeds of 20kph.\nDid the drivers take care of them around the Miami International Autodrome? Absolutely not.\nGiven the competitive nature of our drivers, the parade turned into a race very, very quickly with some hilarious consequences. Have you ever seen a happier group?\nBest radio message – ‘Must be the water’\nWe’ve had some stunning exchanges on the airwaves in 2025 – from Lewis Hamilton’s “have a tea break while you’re at it” to Charles Leclerc’s “thank you Bryan”, and let’s not forget Verstappen remarking that his shifts felt like “Monaco Grand Prix 1972”.\nBut the winner of best radio message this season was an absolute all-timer courtesy of Leclerc.\n“I have the seat full of water!” the Monegasque told his race engineer Bryan Bozzi during the Australian Grand Prix, as his drinks bottle leaked. “Must be the water,” replied Bozzi before Leclerc responded: “Let’s add that to the words of wisdom.”\nLeclerc would of course go on to clarify that it was an inside joke between the pair, but that moment still gave us a radio message that will be included in every ‘best of’ compilation from here on.\nBest special livery – Red Bull’s Honda livery in Japan\nWe’ve had plenty of contenders for this category in 2025 as well, with Ferrari’s retro effort at Monza – which celebrated the 50th anniversary of Niki Lauda’s first world title – a close runner-up.\nBut here we are crowning Red Bull’s effort for the Japanese Grand Prix as the best special livery of 2025. Not only did the design honour the final year of their partnership with Honda but, well, look at it! A thing of beauty.\n1 / 3\nRed Bull's livery in Japan honoured their partnership with Honda\nBest special helmet – Lewis Hamilton in Las Vegas\nGiven we had just as many special helmet designs as liveries this year – if not more – then we had to dish out an award here too. For that we give it to Hamilton for his Las Vegas special lid.\nAfter all, it sparkled! You get automatic bonus points for a helmet that sparkles.\nBest stat – Nico Hulkenberg had the longest career in F1 history before scoring a first podium finish (238 Grands Prix over 15 years)\nAside from our championship battle in 2025, Nico Hulkenberg’s podium at the British Grand Prix was comfortably one of our favourite stories of the year. The German used all his experience to navigate the difficult weather conditions that day, rising from 19th on the grid to an astonishing third.\nAnd, on what was his 239th start, he finally put to bed the stat that had followed him as the driver with the longest F1 career to never score a top-three finish. The stat above makes for far better reading.\nThat result was also Sauber’s first podium finish since Japan 2012, with Kamui Kobayashi, and Hulkenberg was the oldest first-time podium finisher (37 years old) since George Follmer (39 years old) at the 1973 Spanish Grand Prix.\nBest trophy mishap – Isack Hadjar in Zandvoort\nSticking with surprise, feel-good podiums we now come to Isack Hadjar , who took a well-deserved third in Zandvoort in his rookie season in the sport.\nWhile his on-track exploits were flawless, his handling of the trophy was… less so. As Racing Bulls posed for their celebration photos in the pit lane, the French driver placed his trophy on the ground before accidentally snapping the neck.\nThankfully Prince Bernhard of Orange got involved to replace the broken trophy, with Hadjar presented with the replacement ahead of the Italian Grand Prix.\nBest example of perseverance – Hadjar and his seatbelt\nHadjar gets not one, but two, alternative award wins this year, with his efforts in Japan comfortably earning him the best example of perseverance.\nTo say the French rookie had a rollercoaster Qualifying hour in Suzuka is an understatement as it emerged his seatbelts had been fastened in an uncomfortably tight manner . When we say uncomfortable, we mean uncomfortable…\nUnsurprisingly that impacted his focus and ability to put a strong lap together in Q1, and his radio messages were pained to say the least. But the rookie ground through all the discomfort and scraped into Q2, where the issue could then be sorted in the gap. He went on to qualify an impressive seventh.\nBest example of multitasking – Lando Norris’ expensive lawnmower\nThe Japanese Grand Prix also gave us the best demonstration of multitasking as Norris and Verstappen battled for track position coming out of the pit exit. In the key flash point of the race, Norris ended up on the grass as Verstappen held his position out front.\n“Quite an expensive lawnmower,” said Verstappen in the cooldown room afterwards to his McLaren rival.\nThat theme continued as Verstappen joked in the press conference after: “I think the grass was not really well cut on the right-hand side. Lando saw that as well and he made sure that it was nicely cut.”\n“I wasn’t even trying to race Max, I was just trying to cut the grass like he says,” Norris added.\nBest apology – Alex Albon and George Russell’s dinner date\nTo say George Russell was left frustrated in the Monaco Grand Prix is perhaps one of the understatements of the year.\nAfter a loss of power in Qualifying left him 14th on the grid, the Mercedes driver ended up stuck in traffic as Williams played a tactical game ahead with drivers Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz . The pair would take it in turns to back the pack up to create space for a free pit stop – this happening four times in succession as both drivers completed their two mandatory stops.\nRussell eventually became so frustrated by being unable to overtake that he skipped over the Nouvelle Chicane to pass Albon and refused to give the position back, which saw him handed a drive-through penalty by the stewards.\nAfter the race, both Williams drivers apologised for the tactical play, while Russell joked that Albon owed him dinner as compensation. As it transpired that dinner date did happen after the race.\n“He ordered the most expensive thing on the menu,” Albon said afterwards when asked how the dinner was. “He did, actually. It was the lobster pasta.”\nBest carpool moment of the season – Verstappen, Russell and Yuki Tsunoda in Brazil\nIn another drivers’ parade with a twist, the Sao Paulo Grand Prix offered up soapboxes for the drivers to enjoy this time around.

Explore everything Yas Island and the city offer, including golden-hour racing, standout food with marina views, Fanzones, and after-hours celebrations. This guide gives you the complete breakdown for an unforgettable race weekend.\nThe Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is the final chapter of the Formula 1 season, with Yas Island delivering the perfect setting for a dramatic conclusion. With golden-hour racing, marina views and a circuit built around spectacle, this is where titles are sealed and legends are made. The energy builds quickly across the island as the week progresses, turning the championship finale into one of the most anticipated weekends on the calendar.\nFor fans, the excitement builds the moment you arrive on Yas Island. Palm-lined walkways fill, the marina gathers team-decorated yachts, and the glowing panels of the Yas Hotel create a stunning backdrop as the sun sets.\nFanzones fill with music and activity, restaurants open onto the promenade, and the entire waterfront feels alive as the final sessions approach. Engines echoing across the island and golden light settling over the circuit means it’s time for the title showdown – and here is how to make the most of your Abu Dhabi trip.\nChill before the thrill\nBefore the track sessions begin, Abu Dhabi offers plenty of things to see and do. With beachfront strolls, standout food and cultural highlights, the city is perfect for roaming around before the evening’s entertainment.\nQasr Al Watan: Visit the Presidential Palace in the morning before crowds build – the marble halls and intricate designs make for a stunning cultural stop. Your race ticket includes also access to the palace.\nWalk the Corniche: The Corniche is a postcard stretch of waterfront with palm lined paths, cycle lanes and sweeping views across the Gulf. Visit the 8km (5 mi) promenade in the morning for cooler temperatures and quiet seaside energy.\nMust-see theme parks: Get your adrenaline pumping by riding the world’s fastest rollercoaster – Formula Rossa at Ferrari World. It’s a fun warm-up to the real racing action, and your Grand Prix ticket includes free entry to one Yas Island theme park, such as Yas Waterworld and SeaWorld.\nSheikh Zayed Grand Mosque: One of the most breathtaking landmarks in the UAE – the mosque is the largest one in the country. Explore the vast courtyards, admire the architecture and enjoy the golden chandeliers. It is an active mosque, so make sure you are respectful of worshippers.\nLouvre Abu Dhabi: Arrive mid-morning for soft light under the museum’s famous dome. The galleries mix global art, architecture and culture in this collaborative project with France, and is included in your race ticket.\nEnjoy magical museums: The ticket also includes entry to the teamLab Phenomena, a cutting-edge multisensory art museum, the Natural History Museum Abu Dhabi, and Zayed National Museum – so why not take advantage and take in some Emirati culture.\nYas Mall brunch: Gather your energy with a leisurely brunch at one of the mall’s cafes or bistros. Ideal for race day fuel.\nMangrove kayaking: Explore Abu Dhabi’s protected mangroves on a guided kayak tour as you paddle through quiet channels and spot native birdlife.\nMorning at Saadiyat Beach: Start your day with a calm walk on the white sand and a swim in clear turquoise waters. It is one of Abu Dhabi’s most peaceful spots.\nGetting there: your route to Yas Marina Circuit\nYas Marina Circuit sits on Yas Island, about 30 minutes from central Abu Dhabi and only a short ride from most hotels in the area. The island is well connected during race weekend with clear signage, dedicated fan routes and smooth transport options that make your life easier.\nShuttle buses: Free event shuttles run from major Yas Island stops and selected partner hotels. They will drop you close to key gate entrances and operate regularly throughout the day.\nRide services and taxis: Uber, Careem and local taxis are widely available. Set your drop off point to the exact gate printed on your ticket for a quicker arrival.\nWalking: If you are staying on Yas Island, several hotels are within walking distance of the track. Follow the pedestrian paths and fan wayfinding signs to reach your designated section.\nDriving and parking: A limited number of parking zones are available for pass holders. If you are driving, plan to arrive early, as parking fills up fast during race weekend. Shuttles and walking remain your best bet.\nLeaving the circuit: It can get very busy immediately after the chequered flag or concerts, so feel free to take a short break at a nearby resort or waterfront venue to let the crowds thin. After that, it’s much easier to make your way back using taxis, shuttles and walkways.\nInside the circuit and photo spots\nYas Marina Circuit is one of the most striking venues on the calendar. Its waterfront setting, flowing corners and glowing architecture make it a spectacular place to explore as the sun sets. The track blends high speed sections with tight technical turns, giving fans unique views from every grandstand as the race transitions into darkness.\nMust-see corners and views\nFor the best view of wheel-to-wheel action, head straight for the West Grandstand. It overlooks the high-speed run into Turn 6–7, one of the prime overtaking zones of the lap, so you can gasp at the drivers going late on the brakes.\nThe marina section offers Yas Marina’s most iconic backdrop. Cars sweep past the yachts and under the glowing panels of the Yas Hotel, which lights up beautifully as the sun sets.\nIf you prefer atmosphere over apexes, the Main Grandstand is the heartbeat of race day. It overlooks the start-finish straight and hosts Abu Dhabi’s famous post-race pyrotechnics. You may even spot some donuts...\nWherever you choose to sit, higher seats offer wider views and more shade during the warm afternoon sessions.\nTop photo spots\nThe most iconic shot is from the Yas Marina Broadwalk. Capture cars sweeping past the yachts with the Yas Hotel glowing in the background. It will be best either just before sunset or when the hotel lights the night sky.\nCheck out under the Yas Hotel canopy for dramatic overhead angles. Walk the elevated areas around the hotel as the LED panels create colourful patterns as cars flash beneath you.\nThe back straight leading into Turn 6-7 is excellent for panning shots, with the afternoon light adding a golden streak to the motion blue.\nThe Turn 1 banking is a great angle for the race launch – shoot from higher ground to capture the full grid as they charge into the opening corner.\nFanzone\nAbu Dhabi’s Fanzones are spread across Yas Marina Circuit and the surrounding island, each offering its own mix of entertainment, culture and trackside energy. Set alongside the marina, waterfront walkways and major grandstands, these zones create a lively festival atmosphere as the afternoon sessions roll into sunset.\nExpect live music, shaded lounge areas, pop-up cafes, food stalls, racing simulators, merchandise stands and interactive displays. Most race tickets include access to all Fanzones and the Yasalam After-Race Concerts, so you can make the most of everything happening across Yas Island.\nTop fan hack\nDownload the official Abu Dhabi Grand Prix app before you arrive to access track timings, interactive maps, team and driver appearance timings, and full details on Fanzones and event activations throughout Yas Island.\nAfter the chequered flag – Abu Dhabi nights\nWhen the race finishes, Yas Island turns into a full celebration. Crowds stream toward Yas Bay, music fills the waterfront and the island’s restaurants, lounges and entertainment spots stay open well into the night.\nPost-race concerts at Etihad Park: Across the road from the circuit, Etihad Park hosts major music acts throughout the weekend. Your ticket unlocks access to these concerts, making it one of the biggest post-race gatherings on Yas Island.\nOfficial Abu Dhabi GP after-parties: From exclusive VIP events to large open-air celebrations, the Grand Prix’s official after-parties bring DJs, live performances and high-energy crowds.

It’s one of Abu Dhabi’s top spots for a polished night out after the race.\nSaadiyat Beach Club for upscale late-night lounging: Saadiyat’s beach clubs offer an elegant poolside, relaxed music and refined drinks in a quieter, coastal setting away from the crowds.\nFoodie fuel – what to eat and drink\nAbu Dhabi’s food culture blends Emirati traditions with Gulf flavours, Levantine influences and modern dining. Whether you’re exploring Yas Island or heading into the city, these dishes and drinks offer a real taste of the UAE.\nHarees: A slow-cooked dish of wheat and tender meat beaten together until silky and smooth. It’s traditionally served during celebrations and is loved for its comforting, hearty flavour.\nMadrooba: A rich Emirati stew made with salted fish, spices and thickened sauce. It’s savoury, unique and a great way to try a dish rooted in the region’s coastal heritage.\nKhubz (fresh Emirati bread): Often baked in clay ovens and served hot, this bread pairs perfectly with dips like hummus, moutabal and fresh labneh. Look out for spots where it’s made fresh.\nRegag bread snacks: Thin, crispy Emirati bread cooked on a hot dome and topped with cheese, honey or spices. It’s a popular street snack and easy to grab on the go.\nShish taouk and mixed grills: A staple across Abu Dhabi. Juicy skewers of marinated chicken or meat served with warm bread, pickles and garlic sauce. Ideal for a filling meal before the afternoon sessions.\nKnafeh: A stretchy, sweet Middle Eastern dessert made with cheese, crispy pastry and syrup. Many cafes serve it warm, making it a perfect late-night treat after the race.\nArabic coffee (Gahwa) with dates: A traditional Emirati welcome. Light, aromatic coffee spiced with cardamom, poured into small cups and served with soft, caramel-sweet dates.\nMint lemonade: A refreshing local favourite: zesty, ice-cold and vivid green. Perfect for hot afternoons on Yas Island.\nTravel hacks and tips\nWeather and what to pack: Expect warm, sunny days and mild evenings. Pack breathable clothing, sunscreen, sunglasses, a hat and comfortable shoes for walking around Yas Island. A light layer is handy once the sun disappears.\nLocal time and rhythm: Abu Dhabi runs on Gulf Standard Time, while the city goes to great efforts to provide entertainment long into the night. Many places will stay open late, so take advantage of the chill days and intense evenings.\nSafety and etiquette: The UAE is welcoming and modern, but modesty is appreciated. Dress respectfully when visiting cultural sites and be mindful of public behaviour. Couples should avoid overt displays of affection in public areas. There are women-only taxis available, identifiable by their pink roof.\nMoney and payments: Cards are accepted almost everywhere, including taxis, restaurants and Fanzone stalls. Keeping United Arab Emirates Dirham on hand is useful for small purchases or local cafés.\nPower and charging: The UAE uses plug type G, the same as the UK. Bring a universal adapter and a portable power bank to keep devices charged through long race days.\nLocal phrases and basics: Arabic is the primary language spoken in the UAE, and while English is widely understood across Abu Dhabi, it is respectful to learn a few basic Arabic greetings when meeting people. Try out these ones below:\nHello: As-salaam alaykum (ah-sah-LAHM ah-LAY-kum)\nThank you: Shukran (SHOOK-ran)\nGood evening: Masaa al khayr (mah-SAH al KHAIR)\nPlease to a man: Min fadlak (min FAD-lak)\nPlease to a woman: Min fadlik (min FAD-lik)\nGoodbye: Ma’a salama (mah-ah sah-LAH-mah)"}

[One is] being in a world champion team. When I grew up watching Formula 1, I saw Vettel winning all these races, as a kid, with Red Bull .\n“And [the second thing is] being team mates with Max, to see what it's like – what facing the best level in the world feels like. It's definitely super exciting.”\nElaborating further on what he admires about Verstappen, Hadjar said: “What I find very impressive with Max is that, after four World Championships, he’s still very hungry, and very mad when it doesn’t go his way because he always wants to win.\n“I don’t think every champion can do that; once you’ve passed a certain level you can maybe slow down a bit in your approach, but he seems to be starting just like I am, so it’s very impressive.”\nAnd while the step up is one that he is excited about, the young driver is not carrying any specific expectations into his sophomore season, one in which a wave of new technical regulations will come into effect.\n“I have no expectations at all because it's starting from scratch, everyone,” he explained. “So yeah, the work is going to be done. I'm just really looking forward to January, February, working with the team, getting to know all the people. It's going to be crucial to try and be ahead a bit.”\nThe drivers and teams will first be in action during a private pre-season test held at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya from January 26-30, while two three-day tests will follow at the Bahrain International Circuit on February 11-13 and February 18-20."}

They deserve better, for sure.”\nOn the other side of the Ferrari garage, Charles Leclerc managed to drag his car into the final Q3 segment and secure fifth on the grid, having made “massive” set-up changes after Friday practice in a bid to find more pace.\n“I’m very pleased with P5,” he said. “It’s a shame to be pleased with P5, but that’s all we had today. I’m satisfied with the performance of today and the laps in Q3.\n“I just hope that next year we’ll start on the right foot, and we’ll be back winning races, because that’s all I want.\n“Let’s say if we look only at this weekend, it’s been a good recovery from the team. We’ve changed massively the car from FP2 to FP3, took a huge risk, and it paid off, because we probably would have been P9, something around that, if we didn’t change the car.”\nAsked about his outlook for Sunday’s race, with the three title contenders starting just ahead of him, Leclerc signed off: “I don’t know. Surely, I will take massive risks tomorrow and try and be on the podium for the last race – that’s all that matters to me.\n“Of course, there’s a title fight, but on my side the only thing I’m looking at is what can I do for Ferrari, and that is trying to maximise tomorrow’s result no matter who I fight. That will be my mentality going into tomorrow.”"}

While there were positive moments – including his Sprint victory in China – there have also been trickier times, and Hamilton is yet to stand on a Grand Prix podium since joining the team.\nLooking back on the positive factors that he will carry into next season ahead of this campaign’s finale in Abu Dhabi , Hamilton reflected on his introduction to life as a Ferrari driver.\n“I'll always remember the first day in Maranello, and the first day driving when my family were there in Fiorano,” he explained. “I will carry the spirit of this team. The team has the best spirit, the people here in this team have the best energy.\n“It's a really beautiful environment to work in because of the people and there's so much passion there, so I just take that bundle of passion and just try and put that into next season.”\nIn terms of the biggest lesson that he has learned during the year, Hamilton responded: “That I'm resilient. I said it in the last race, I've surprised myself with how resilient I am and, if I can get through a season like this, then there's nothing that I can't face moving forward.”\nGiven the challenges that he and the team have experienced during the season, Hamilton opened up about how he will learn from this campaign and the approach that he will take when it comes to making changes.\n“It's not actually a straightforward process,” the 40-year-old said. “We're obviously testing next week and then we go back to the factory. I've got to decide what my approach is when it comes to sitting down with the key stakeholders to make the decisions, and how that approach is to create the change that's needed.\n“In terms of personal reflection, every weekend I've written down what I felt went wrong that weekend, the decisions I've taken, so there's a lot of learnings to do there. Through my break I will analyse those decisions and make markers on how I can make better decisions in the future.\n“My surroundings in terms of personal personnel, team personnel, how you utilise people, whether people need to move into different positions to work better – all these different things need to be looked upon in my personal space so that we can optimise our teamwork.”\nHamilton answered “yes” when pushed further on whether changes have to be made – and when asked if they could not just carry on, he added: “Definitely not.”\nFor now the focus is on the final weekend of the current championship in Abu Dhabi – and while a title fight is playing out ahead between Lando Norris , Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri , Hamilton does not expect Ferrari to play a role in that battle.\n“We're nothing to do with what's happening at the forefront,” he explained. “Some weekends our car is a little bit more competitive than others. We know our car is not on par with the top three teams – that's inevitably why we’re where we are.\n“But we come here in full force. Everyone is really positive – we want to end on a high and I'm incredibly proud of every single person in the team. I really hope this weekend we can deliver something positive and leave off on the right foot.”"}

I’m extremely grateful for their support and all the work we've done, but especially with Dr Marko.\n“It's not been the easiest year for me. I'm not happy with how it's gone, but he believed in me when others didn't, and I'm very grateful for that.\n“I find it funny when a lot of people say how difficult it can be to work with him, their stories of how they struggled to work with Dr Marko, how he's very difficult and people are scared of him. For me, it's always been the opposite. I've always had a very good relationship with him.\n“There are certain things he wants to see, and I mean, I can’t talk for others and their experience, but I’ve always had a very good relationship with him, and he’s helped my career massively. The fact that he believed in me when others didn't, I'm very grateful towards him, because this opportunity wouldn't have come without him.\n“I don't really like excuses and when people talk rubbish, and he doesn't do that – he just says the truth, and I like to do the same. I think on that side, it's helped me. It's helped me to learn the best way, helped me progress the fastest, because he just says the truth and the way things have been. And I appreciate that honesty as well, because there are a lot of people in motorsport who want you to tell them what they want to hear.”\nAs the sole rookie on next season’s grid, Lindblad will have plenty to learn, but Red Bull have supported his quick progression through the junior formulas – and he outlined the additional help they have provided through offering Free Practice opportunities and the chance to drive previous iterations of their cars.\nMost recently, he featured in the annual post-season test in Abu Dhabi, in which both regular drivers and rookies take part. He completed an impressive 139 laps and ended the day just 0.014s slower than his Racing Bulls team mate Liam Lawson .\nLindblad explained:  “I've been doing a lot on the sim with [Red Bull]. I have been for a while now, already started a bit last year, and then obviously, I've been doing some of the FP1s, a little bit of TPC [Testing of Previous Cars] running. So I've been doing a lot of work with Red Bull.\n“I think that it isn’t just F2 that has helped the decision [to choose me] for next year. I’ve been working closely with [Red Bull] for a long time. It’s my fifth year on the programme, so I have a very close relationship with all of them.”"}

Piastri wound up third overall in the standings , 13 points behind his team mate at the end of a hard-fought season.\nThe result could well have been harder to take for the Australian than for Verstappen – who fell just two points short – given that Piastri led the championship for more races than anyone else. He enjoyed a 34-point lead over Norris after Zandvoort, the 15th race of the 24 Grand Prix season.\nBut Brown is sure his driver will be back even stronger next year and sees no reason to change the status quo within McLaren of letting both drivers race each other week in, week out.\n“He is a future World Champion. Both our guys won seven races, drove brilliantly, they supported each other,” Brown said in the aftermath of Abu Dhabi. “It's a cruel sport, things sometimes go your way, sometimes they don't [in a way that's] out of your control but I'm excited to go racing with these two guys next year.”\nPiastri's season arguably began to unravel after Baku, a weekend where he failed to finish after crashing twice and jumping the start. That then led to a run of five races where he finished off the podium – allowing both Norris and Verstappen to catch and then pass him in the standings.\nAnd while he did not convert a sizeable championship lead into the title in 2025, Piastri at least came back fighting at the end of the season, winning the Sprint in Qatar, while he arguably should have had an eighth Grand Prix victory that weekend as well.\n“I don't think [Piastri] needs to pick himself up. He should be proud. He won seven races, led the championship. Of course, he'll be disappointed, but I don't think there's anything he needs to pick himself up from. I think he just needs to go again,” Brown said.\n“I think we've learnt a lot this year but as far as letting our guys race. We let them race all the way down to the end, including Oscar doing a pass around the outside [on Norris on Lap 1 in Abu Dhabi]. So, we're definitely going to continue with that, but I think like you do every weekend, you learn, you refine.\n“We'll work with the drivers and go, we'll give you equal opportunities or things you want to do differently and the way you do that. We've got two guys capable of winning the World Championship, we'll see what happens next year.”\nWith seven wins apiece in 2026 and separated by just 13 points at the end of a 24-race season, all eyes will be on McLaren in 2026 to see which driver comes out on top in their intra-team fight."}

For me, he’s obviously had a great season this year and a deserving champion, but he’s still Lando Norris. It’s not like he’s become Superman.\n“So, I don’t think things will change with that. I’m expecting full fairness from the team and equality going forward. I don’t have any concerns that that will change at all. Clearly, Lando’s had a very strong season this year, and ultimately did a better job.”\nMcLaren became known for their ‘papaya rules’ in 2025, with the squad voicing their intention to treat Norris and Piastri equally and give both the same opportunity to win the title. While this approach occasionally came in for criticism , Piastri believes that the outfit’s success in both the Drivers’ and Teams’ Championship shows that the strategy has worked.\n“I think it is a testament to the way we go racing,” the nine-time race winner explained. “Obviously, it’s not easy fighting for both the Constructors’ Championship and the Drivers’ Championship with two very evenly matched drivers. But ultimately, that’s a problem we knew we were going to have.\n“At the end of the day, I think there’s a lot of good things that come from that. Yes, there’s difficult moments and tension at times, but I think both Lando and I have become better drivers from pushing each other to the limit.\n“Sometimes that’s been uncomfortable for everyone, but ultimately, yeah, it’s been a good thing. We’ve had a lot of discussions through the year, and I’m sure we’ll have discussions in the off-season about anything we want to do slightly differently for next year.\n“But I think at the end of the day, they gave us both as good a chance as the team could have to fairly fight for a World Championship, and that’s all you can ask for.”"}

In an exclusive interview, costume designer Julian Day explains how the team’s identity, colours, race suits, and fan culture were crafted.\nWhen costume designer Julian Day took on F1 The Movie , he faced a unique challenge – creating and kitting out an entire Formula 1 team in just a few months.\nMost teams spend years developing their identity, uniforms, and brand – from their inception to joining the grid. Cadillac , who join the F1 grid next season, will have had over five years to develop and design all the team details. But for Day, he had little time to create something authentic and unique enough to stand out at Grand Prix weekends and on the silver screen.\nBut that’s exactly what he achieved, as APXGP fit seamlessly into the F1 paddock with impressive realism and a clean aesthetic during their time mixing it with the grid over the 2023 and 2024 seasons. With a little help from some leading brands and manufacturers, Day created team kit, race suits and merchandise with an iconic look that doesn't look out of place during race weekends.\nWith F1 The Movie now streaming on Apple TV+ , there’s no better time to talk to Day about how he achieved such an impressive feat.\nCreating authentic race suits\nThe journey to finding APXGP's signature look was far from straightforward. Day approached OMP, the Italian racewear supplier which kits out Aston Martin , for designs and he would go on to produce multiple racing suit concepts in different colours. Those concepts were then presented to the movie's stars Brad Pitt and Damson Idris, as well as director Joe Kosinski, for feedback.\n\"One day, we were doing a fitting with Brad, and we were struggling to agree on a team colour,\" Day recalled. \"Then I suddenly remembered that I had brought in this sort of silvery white/grey suit, and everybody looked at it and went, 'Yes, this is the one.’\"\nThe choice was strategic. According to Day, going too black would create a \"Darth Vader-esque feel\", while too white would feel vintage.\nThe silver-white struck the perfect balance, complementing the dark colour of the APXGP car and the white of the garage. The suit would also stand out against the rest of the grid on Grand Prix weekends.\nThe racing suits worn by Pitt and Idris featured OMP's fireproofing, including the ONE-S suit, and all equipment was FIA-approved to ensure the same safety standards in real competitions were met during on-track filming.\nDay also discovered the number of complications involved with creating race suits at the highest level of motorsport, especially when it comes to team sponsors. Just as with the real F1 teams, APXGP had a number of high-end sponsorships – and with that, precision matters enormously, even down to the millimeter.\n\"If a sponsor's logo is two millimetres larger on a racing suit, they'll give you another £100,000, or if the logo is too small or in the wrong place, then you're in trouble,\" he explained.\nThe team worked meticulously with the APXGP sponsors to place graphics on the suits, though some logos changed during filming as sponsors updated their branding. If you look hard enough, you might be able to spot the difference between some of the earlier and later scenes!\nProducing a distinctive team kit\nFor the pit crew uniforms, Day drew inspiration from a surprising source – Mercedes . \"I was invited to the Mercedes headquarters to see what they did, and they were very helpful from the beginning, and obviously they use black and white in their uniforms, and we just thought it was perfect.\" Day said.\nThe all-black pit crew kit also served a functional purpose beyond aesthetics in the film – it made the drivers stand out against them. It's a useful feature when you want the audience's eyes to be focused on the stars of the show.\nWith F1 The Movie dedicated to immersing the viewer into the world of F1, the pit crew also wore race-ready uniforms with Day noting the remarkable evolution of racing fabrics. \"I ended up having to order the pit crew uniforms from OMP again, which meant they got the latest fabrics. The fabric these days is so thin, it's almost like shirt material, but completely fireproof.\"\nAchieving meticulous attention to detail\nCreating authentic racing gear required attention to even the most minor details. Day ensured that everything from racing boots to Nomex underwear, gloves, and balaclavas met professional standards for racing. However, some modifications were necessary for filming.\n\"We had to make sure that the visor of the helmet was large enough so the camera could catch the eyes, but it also had to be safe to use,\" Day explained. \"We were also conscious of the fact that racing helmets are very tight and can squeeze your cheeks like a hamster, so we had to sort that out!\"\nThe team even had standbys on set whose job was to pull up the balaclavas around the actors' eyes to ensure everyone looked their best. As Day noted: \"It's all in the minutiae – the details that you don't think about while watching the movie.\"\nWhen producer Lewis Hamilton first saw the racing suit, his feedback was telling. According to Day, Hamilton remarked that it was much lighter than his own suit, a testament to the latest racing fabric technology and how much the movie was able to push the boundaries of authenticity.\nRecruiting fans for a fictional team\nOne of the most innovative aspects of the costume department's work was creating a fanbase for a team that didn't exist.\n\"We produced a whole load of merchandise, and we handed it out at the races,\" Day explained. \"So, when the actors would be doing post-race interviews and post-Qualifying interviews, we'd dress people around them in APXGP caps and t-shirts to look like fans.\"\nThe team's approach to fan representation also evolved as the story progressed. \"Obviously, APXGP are nothing as a team when the film starts, so as they gradually win more races and do better and better, we gave them more fans,\" Day said.\nUnprecedented filming access over race weekends\nConsiderable amounts of filming for the movie took place during live Grand Prix weekends during the 2023 and 2024 seasons, with the assistance of the FIA and Formula 1. Day attended races in Hungary, Silverstone, and Monza, witnessing firsthand how the production was integrated into the F1 schedule.\nIn Las Vegas, driving sequences were often captured in the early hours, around 3:00 a.m. local time over the Grand Prix weekend. Filming also took place at the Circuit Paul Ricard in France and the Circuit of The Americas in Texas, with production continuing through the 2024 season to make up for time lost over the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. However, there were a number of potential complications to consider during filming at these race weekends...\n\"One of the biggest fears was at the British Grand Prix as the two cars were following the grid during the formation lap, and we were nervous in case one of them would break down,\" Day recalled. \"It could've totally changed the actual race. Production did an incredible job making sure that didn’t happen.\"\nThe unprecedented access granted for the production was also a career first for Day, and something he doesn't take for granted.\n\"I don't think a film that integrates into a sport in the way we did will ever happen again,\" he said. \"It's quite extraordinary what they managed to do, to jimmy themselves into the F1 schedule like that.\"\nBringing it together\nDay's meticulous attention to detail aimed to create a seamless visual experience that went beyond anything F1 fans and cinephiles alike have ever seen. \"What I really want people to see is how truthfully I represented what the sport looks like,\" he said.\n\"Because it's such a vast world, you have the race team, but also the paddock and the larger crowds. I tried to include every small detail in the process so that no detail stands out. Hopefully, all the details work together to create the overall look of the film.\"\nWith F1 The Movie released in June 2025 to critical and commercial success, Day's work has not only created a convincing fictional team but has also sparked a fashion evolution within F1 fan culture, with the Tommy Hilfiger APXGP capsule collection becoming highly sought-after. Fans are blending streetwear with racing gear to showcase their identity at Grand Prix weekends like never before – and plenty repping APXGP.\nWe get to relive the magic again from our sofas now that F1 The Movie airs on Apple+ – and it's the perfect opportunity to get out our APXGP and Tommy Hilfiger merchandise again during the off-season!"}

From proper rest, mental switch-offs, and family time to training, travel, and off-track passions, the off-season shapes how drivers return ready for the challenge when lights go out again in Melbourne.\nWith the 2025 season finale in Abu Dhabi behind them, and the private pre-season test in Barcelona coming up at the end of January, the F1 drivers have been enjoying their winter break before getting back to work with the new season approaching.\nSo, what do the drivers do with all that time away from the paddock? Whether it’s proper rest, less (or more!) travel, training, or making more time for family and hobbies – the winter break provides a rare opportunity for them to switch off, reset and begin to prepare for the 2026 campaign.\nLet’s take a look at some of the ways drivers unwind and reset before the paddock reassembles.\nRest!\nFirst things first, there’s one thing the drivers are actively encouraged to do as the winter break begins: rest. Former McLaren driver and current Aston Martin Team Ambassador Pedro de la Rosa explained to the Silverstone-based team's website about the importance of stepping away completely at the end of a season, recalling how his trainer would insist on two full weeks off before any structured work resumed. As the Spaniard puts it, while elite athletes are wired to keep training, the body needs time to recover after such a long campaign.\nWith the Formula 1 calendar now longer and more demanding than ever, the winter downtime will help drivers to avoid burnout before they gradually gear up for the new season. Only once that rest period is over do most drivers begin to return to training – often in differing ways – building fitness up rather than jumping straight to intense race preparation.\nSwitching off and truly disconnecting\nFor most of the drivers, switching off over the winter break isn’t just about putting their phone on ‘do not disturb’ or ignoring calls from team bosses – it's about spending time with the people they rarely get to see during the chaos of the season.\nGeorge Russell has spoken about how he uses the time to step up his “uncle duties”, whereas newly-crowned World Champion Lando Norris has explained that, for him, winter is about enjoying time with his friends and family – and trying to “forget that I drive in Formula 1” for a while. Lewis Hamilton echoed this sentiment after Abu Dhabi, saying he would step away from his phone entirely and “completely unplug from the matrix” while heading to New York to spend time with friends.\nOff track adventures\nWith no race weekends in sight, the drivers have the freedom (within reason!) to chase different adventure – and for many of them, that still comes with a healthy dose of travelling. They frequently love to explore somewhere new altogether, like Alex Albon heading off to Bhutan with his partner Lily Muni He to explore the mountain paths and breathtaking architecture. Incoming Racing Bulls rookie Arvid Lindblad has spent some time in Mumbai to reconnect with his roots ahead of his exciting career move. Russell also chose to explore the snowy Alps from above with partner Carmen Montero Mundt, and perhaps to enjoy some skiing too.\nBase training\nWhile the winter break offers a chance to slow things down, few drivers ever stop training entirely. Instead, many switch up their routines to keep things fresh and mentally engaging after a long season and plenty of workouts. Charles Leclerc , for example, has previously used winter ski camps as part of his December preparation, with cross-country skiing offering a full-body workout that builds endurance and lactic acid that would be sure to warm him up!\nOne element of training that is non-negotiable – even over the winter break – is general conditioning, especially vital areas such as neck strength. Gabriel Bortoleto has given fans glimpses of his winter break gym routine, whilst Valtteri Bottas has dialled up the intensity in the gym as he prepares for his return to the grid this coming season with Cadillac.\nMaintaining an aerobic base is just as crucial over this period. Many drivers keep that ticking over with long bike rides (no prizes for guessing Bottas and Carlos Sainz ), some steady running – Hamilton has been doing just that in New York – and, almost certainly, plenty of padel.\nHobbies, passions, and side quests\nThe end-of-season break is also the best time for drivers to lean into interests that sit outside the cockpit. Ever the competitors, tickling the sporting itch is a go-to activity for much of the grid. Some choose to stick to the winter theme, with Pierre Gasly , Lance Stroll and Russell all spotted in the snow on social media. Others fancy 18 holes in the sunshine, with Sainz and Leclerc both enjoying some golf in Mexico over the years. And of course, padel and tennis remain the paddock’s favourite racquet sports, and the time off gives them all even more opportunity to improve their skills.\nLiam Lawson and Gasly have spent some time in the off-season giving back to the community through some heart-warming charity work. Gasly, an ambassador for Make-A-Wish France, attended the charity’s end-of-year gala, which raised money to help the emotional wellbeing of children in care. Over in Cromwell, New Zealand, Lawson gave hot laps to winners of a silent auction to raise over NZ$50,000 for breast cancer research.\nOf course, not everyone can stay away from the thrill of four wheels. Almost as soon as the 2025 season wrapped up, Max Verstappen was back in the car, as he jumped into a Mercedes GT3 for a test in Portugal. Esteban Ocon took a more nostalgic route, as he returned to his old karting track, whilst Fernando Alonso eased off the intensity with relaxed Sunday rides."}

The two most recent examples where there have been three or more contenders going into the final round were back in 2010 and 2007. So, how did those unfold?\nThere are moments in Formula 1 that hang around in the memory, and those championship deciders are certainly two of them. Both had multiple competitors at varying stages of their careers battling it out to be the world number one – and in the end, neither of those seasons were won by the person leading the standings at the start of the last race.\nThat might not be the best news for Norris , but it gives Verstappen and Piastri more than a glimmer of hope, with a 12 and 16-point gap to the Briton respectively. With that in mind, we take a look at how those previous underdogs clawed their way back to write their names in the history books…\nHow Hamilton, Alonso and Raikkonen kept themselves in the battle in 2007\nAt the beginning of 2007, the grid had already been shaken up with a myriad of driver changes. Some of the most important included Kimi Raikkonen replacing the retiring Michael Schumacher at Ferrari , and reigning champion Fernando Alonso switching from Renault to McLaren where he was partnered by promising young rookie Lewis Hamilton .\nThe Spaniard undoubtedly had the momentum after storming to two consecutive world titles, but it was Raikkonen who took pole and the first victory of the season on his Ferrari debut, kickstarting a fantastic rivalry between the Scuderia and McLaren .\nIn the opening five rounds, the wins were split between the Finn, Alonso and Ferrari’s second driver Felipe Massa, with few people expecting the then 22-year-old Hamilton to seriously challenge his more experienced team mate, despite finishing on the podium in every race.\nIt was in Round 6 that he claimed his maiden victory – after four Safety Cars and a major crash for BMW Sauber’s Robert Kubica, the Briton won at the Canadian Grand Prix and subsequently took the lead of the championship.\nAnother youngster, Sebastian Vettel, joined the grid as Kubica’s replacement, but his arrival – which made waves in the sport for years to come – was somewhat overshadowed by the infamous ‘Spygate’ scandal .\nIn essence, a Ferrari mechanic illegally provided confidential information to an employee at McLaren – you can find more of the gritty details here , but the controversy had a major impact on the season as the Woking outfit were eventually disqualified from the Constructors’ Championship, effectively handing the title to their Italian rivals.\nIt was no secret that in the fallout, Hamilton, Alonso and team boss Ron Dennis weren’t the best of friends, but critically, the drivers were permitted to keep their individual points. Heading into the finale, the Briton narrowly led with a total of 107 points and four wins under his belt.\nAlonso had 104 points, and Räikkönen was a further four behind on 100 – the sole Ferrari contender needed not only one of his best races of the year, but also had to rely on his competitors falling apart.\nWhat happened in the 2007 finale?\nAt the Brazilian Grand Prix – Abu Dhabi didn’t host a finale until 2009 – none of the top three claimed pole position, with Massa instead securing his ninth of the season. Hamilton claimed the next best spot of P2, followed by the Finnish driver in third and Alonso in fourth to ensure that it was very much all to play for.\nThe Ferrari pair got a much better launch at lights out, allowing Räikkönen to charge past the Briton before Alonso did exactly the same thing. An attempt to repass his team mate saw Hamilton lock up and drive wide, rejoining the track in eighth place. But his reputation for fighting back through the field didn’t come from nowhere – he overtook Jarno Trulli and Nick Heidfeld within seven laps before disaster struck.\nHis McLaren began to painfully slow down as the gearbox failed, and over perhaps the slowest 30 seconds of his career, he fought to bring the car back to life. Eventually, Hamilton was able to reset the machine and get going again, but by that point he found himself in P18.\nFrom Lap 20, the frontrunners began to pit, ending with Massa leading Räikkönen by a few seconds, with Alonso 17 seconds further behind. Hamilton was gradually gaining after choosing to go for a risky three-stop strategy, but he was still over a minute off P1.\nThe second round of pit stops proved to be pivotal as Räikkönen overcut Massa by stopping three laps later and emerging in the lead of the race. With the final laps approaching, the Ferrari pair continued to extend a comfortable margin over Alonso and were eventually seen lapping Hamilton.\nOne lap to go and the Briton got another position, improving to seventh place, but it was too little too late. Räikkönen took the chequered flag after a gripping 71 laps, winning the championship by a single point over both Hamilton and Alonso.\nMassa was second, securing a fourth 1-2 finish for Ferrari, and Alonso staggered into third over 57 seconds behind the victor.\nA record-breaking fight between Alonso, Webber, Vettel and Hamilton in 2010\nIf you thought a three-way battle for the title was dramatic, how about four? For the first, and currently, only time in F1 history, a quartet of drivers were up to be crowned world number one in the final round of the 2010 season.\nThree years on from his 2007 loss, Alonso changed his allegiance to Ferrari and just like Räikkönen before him, won on his debut. Unexpectedly, he owed the victory to Red Bull hotshot Vettel, who was dominating at the season opener in Bahrain until a spark plug issue brought his race to a premature end.\nIt was a similar story in the next round at Albert Park – the German driver took pole position and was well on his way to his first win of the season, but this time it was a brake problem that saw him retire from the race. Despite his misfortune, he was still doing a pretty good job of showing up his team mate Mark Webber, who started the year with an underwhelming eighth and ninth.\nIt didn’t take too long for their rivalry to dramatically grow as the Aussie became fired up when he charged to P2 behind Vettel at the Malaysian Grand Prix, motivating him to improve to the top step in Spain and Monaco.\nThe tension between the pair was palpable, so it seemed somewhat inevitable when they finally collided in Turkey.\nWhile their intra-team battle was boiling over, Alonso and Hamilton were gradually ticking off the rounds, albeit with some fairly inconsistent performances. Everything from strategy and illegal passes to costly crashes and mechanical failures plagued their seasons, but the points nevertheless kept going up and up.\nAs a result, no one really emerged as the obvious favourite for the championship, but over time both the bad luck and victories were shared between the four contenders, so much so that they arrived in Abu Dhabi with 24 points separating them.\nAlonso was in the lead with 246 points, hungry to claim a third title. Webber and Vettel had just seven points between them, with the Aussie ahead on 238. And never to be ruled out, Hamilton began the final round with 222 points, still mathematically in the fight.\nWhat happened in the 2010 finale?\nJust like 2025, there were a range of permutations – second place would be enough for the Spaniard to win for Ferrari, and he was undoubtedly in the best form having secured 105 points over the prior five rounds, more than any other driver.\nWebber needed to win and see Alonso cross the line in third or lower, while Vettel depended on the Ferrari finishing sixth. Meanwhile, Hamilton faced the most unlikely scenario as he was required to win while his three rivals failed to score, and even then he would only take the championship by a single point.\nThe Yas Marina Circuit isn’t particularly known for its overtaking opportunities, which was great news for Vettel as he secured an all-important pole position. But his competition wasn’t far behind as Hamilton, Alonso, Jenson Button and Webber lined up just behind him on the grid.\nLuckily, Vettel got a strong start and led the field well while Alonso dropped to third. It then didn’t take long for the Safety Car to be deployed as Michael Schumacher spun out of the race and Force India’s Vitantonio Liuzzi ploughed into him, slowing down the pack.\nThe pit stops proved to be crucial in this race as Webber boxed on Lap 11 and managed to evade an overcut from Massa, but couldn’t find a way past Alonso, who himself got stuck behind Vitaly Petrov and Nico Rosberg.\nWhile he fought to pass the pair, Vettel and Hamilton continued to extend the gap at the front before they both changed their tyres, with the Red Bull driver remaining ahead. He only had to overtake Button, who had yet to stop, while Hamilton had both Kubica and Kamui Kobayashi in front of him.\nOnce Button pitted, Vettel was able to make the most of the clean air and eventually crossed the line 10 seconds ahead of Hamilton, but faced an agonising wait while the others caught up. Finally, after what felt like an age for 23-year-old, the iconic radio message “Du bist Weltmeister!” rang out, confirming that Alonso and Webber had finished the race in P7 and P8.\nThe German hadn’t led the standings at any stage that season, and yet he beat Alonso to the crown by four points.\nIt took two rounds for Räikkönen to overturn what was a 17-point advantage for Hamilton in 2007. It took Vettel one to recover the 15-point gap to claim his first title in 2010 and set himself on the path to three more.\nIf they could do it, can Verstappen? Can Piastri? It’s easy to get caught up in the permutations, but the important thing is it all comes down to one final race. We've seen it happen before, and it's not something you want to miss."}

I think the baseline performance and the balance of the car are in a good spot, and we had a clean, smooth day so that was positive.”\nIn terms of whether the squad’s strong performance had come as a surprise to them, the 38-year-old said: “Maybe slightly surprising – obviously there’s a bit more low-speed content, which I think is not so bad for our car, but you never know until you run.\n“It’s nice to be quick on Friday, but it’s more important to have it tomorrow when it matters.”\nBortoleto similarly acknowledged that having good pace on a Friday does not necessarily mean it will continue throughout the rest of the weekend, but the Brazilian still voiced his confidence for the team’s prospects on Saturday.\n“It’s just Free Practice,” he commented after the session. “I think there are a lot of things still to happen.\n“Obviously it’s positive to be so competitive in FP1 and FP2, have a good pace, so I’m confident for tomorrow. But again, it’s just FP, there are a lot of people around that are also quick and super-close, so it’s not going to be easy but hopefully we put a good performance tomorrow.”\nWith Kick Sauber still in the fight for eighth place of the Teams’ Championship – the squad currently sitting in P9, only five points adrift of Haas – Bortoleto admitted that Qualifying could be crucial in terms of whether both he and Hulkenberg can claim some valuable points on Sunday.\n“I hope both of the cars are in a good position tomorrow for Quali because it’s going to be very important for us [to have] a good starting position on Sunday, to try to score points and catch the cars ahead of us,” the 21-year-old conceded."}

A much-needed quick stop allowed him to leapfrog fourth-placed Kimi Antonelli , who suffered a slow getaway after his own stop.\nWith overtaking notoriously difficult at the Lusail International Circuit, Sainz was able to maintain his position and found himself ahead of the McLaren of Lando Norris after the Briton was forced to pit later than his competitors due to their alternative strategy.\nThe Standings leader got within DRS range of Sainz on the final lap after he passed a struggling Antonelli, but it proved to be too late and the Williams driver finished on the podium for the first time since the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.\n“I’m so happy, so proud of the whole team for what we’ve done today,” he said after the race. “We came into this weekend thinking it was going to be the most difficult weekend of the year, and suddenly we came out of it with a podium.\n“We nailed the race pace – I was super quick, much quicker than expected. We nailed the strategy, we nailed the tyre management, nailed the start, nailed all the defending and that brought us an unexpected podium so I could not be prouder.”\nDespite reporting late problems with understeer, his impressive drive secured P5 in the Constructors’ Championship for the Grove-based outfit, marking their highest finish since 2016.\nWith Sainz’s team mate Alex Albon narrowly missing out on the points in P11, he was keen to emphasise that his rapid pit stops were what made the difference amid remarkably tight competition.\nHe said: “That’s why we got everything right today. We had a tough first half of the season where things didn’t come together but we’ve improved in so many areas through the year.\n“Today, there were a few opportunities out there to grab and we grabbed all of them by executing a perfect race. Honestly, I’m over the moon with this podium because I absolutely didn’t expect it.”"}

And we saw it relatively quickly that we wouldn't be fighting for the world title because McLaren was too strong, Red Bull was obviously starting to make big gains, there wasn’t much point in putting all our resources into trying to take the third or second place – if everything was going super well – in the Constructors', at the cost of next year, whichever cost it may be.\n“So yeah, it’s never something you want to do. I would have much preferred pushing the development the whole year to try and clinch that world title, 100%.\n“But if you are in the position that we were in at the beginning of the year, I think it was kind of a no-brainer. So, I don’t regret it.”\nDespite the challenges, Leclerc delivered one pole position and seven podiums, leading to him taking P5 in the Drivers’ Standings, albeit 77 points behind Mercedes’ George Russell .\nHis team mate Lewis Hamilton had a similarly tough campaign with Ferrari as multiple Q1 exits frequently left him downbeat, while it was also his first season without a Grand Prix podium since he joined F1 back in 2007.\nPrompted to elaborate on their troubles, Leclerc continued: “I think for us there's not only one reason. There are many reasons which, at different times, played a role. In the beginning of ’22, we actually started off quite strongly, but we were struggling with porpoising, where Red Bull had a very stable platform.\n“And they were actually quite a lot overweight, so as soon as they took off that weight, they were suddenly at the level where they've been since then. And then for last year, we focused very early on next year’s car, which I hope is a bet that will be a winning one.\n“But for sure, it has some influence from the last two thirds of the season where we've been struggling more than others because we didn't bring that many upgrades. But in general, it's just been a generation of car that was very, very difficult to understand.\n“And what worked back at the factory – I think everybody has been surprised once or more times that when you bring it on track, it doesn't correlate exactly to what you were expecting from that part. And that was the challenge of it. And yeah, other teams did better, especially McLaren and Red Bull.”"}

[Sprint] pole position in Miami, first podium in Canada, Brazil, Vegas...\n“There have been many nice moments, but the whole journey has been incredible and it really helped me to grow as a driver and especially as a person.”\nAntonelli – who ended 2025 in seventh place of the Drivers’ Championship – is now focused on his sophomore season in 2026, for which he will again line up alongside George Russell at Mercedes as the grid prepare to tackle a new wave of technical regulations ."}

It feels like a huge privilege, then, when I strap in for a hot lap of the circuit alongside Mercedes reserve Fred Vesti.\nIn the gap between Thursday’s first and second practice sessions – where, as in the main event, the track is under darkness, lit by the dazzling lights of the city – we set off for one flying tour onboard a Mercedes-AMG GT63 Pro.\n“Just let me know if it’s too fast, or too slow,” says Vesti as we head towards the first corner. Needless to say, when a racing driver is at the wheel – especially one targeting a full-time F1 seat (more on which later) – it soon becomes clear that lack of speed will not be an issue…\nAfter we tackle the first hairpin followed by the Koval Lane straight, I make a concerted effort to take in the iconic sights that flash past, including the inimitable Sphere that greets us as we take a sweeping left and enter the twisting section between Turns 7 and 9.\nFurther landmarks are in store when we reach the Strip itself, charging down the 1.92km straight at speeds of up to 170mph. My respect for drivers like Vesti grows even higher as I get just a small taste of the G-forces they experience at such speeds.\nOnce another tight run of corners from Turns 14 to 16 has brought us back towards the start/finish straight, an unforgettable hot lap – marking a maiden visit to Vegas for both myself and Vesti – is over before I know it.\n“That was my second-ever lap on this track,” Vesti tells me as we pull up. The Dane has logged a vastly higher number on the simulator as part of his reserve duties, however, as he explained 24 hours earlier when we caught up on that – as well as his journey so far and his F1 aspirations – in the slightly calmer setting of the Mercedes hospitality…\nWhat being a reserve driver entails\nThat hot lap was just one aspect of a typically busy race weekend for Vesti. When he’s not supporting the team trackside, the 23-year-old plays a key role by carrying out simulator work back at the squad’s Brackley headquarters, providing information that can be beneficial to drivers George Russell and Kimi Antonelli .\n“The sim work that I do is the main role that contributes to the team every single week,” Vesti explains. “And when I'm back at the base in Brackley, we spend hours, like eight, nine hours a day in the sim, pushing towards more performance and learning.\n“Right now, all eyes are on 2026, and so 80% of the laps I do is in next year's car and has been for a while. But we use the sim to prepare weekends like this as well, also with Kimi and George, so it's a very important way to prep. For example, this weekend, Kimi has never been here before, so for him to get some experience in the sim is very important for him to start on the right foot.”\nAlongside that extensive time in the simulator, Vesti has also had the opportunity to translate his knowledge into real-time by participating in two Free Practice 1 outings in 2025, the first being in Bahrain while another followed more recently in Mexico . These sessions are vital, he admits, in more ways than one.\n“I think for any young driver, the FP1s are very valuable,” he concedes. “It's a way to showcase our talent as young drivers, but it's also a way to embed ourselves with the team. The work we do in the sim, it's a chance to test if those theories actually work out in real life.”\nGetting behind the wheel on these occasions is something that Vesti acknowledges brings “a lot of nerves”, adding: “Of course, you want to do as well as possible. You get one hour in a car you don't really know – that's a challenge.”\nAdapting to an ‘insane’ schedule\nHis outing in Russell’s W16 at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez formed part of a particularly industrious few days for Vesti, a week that saw him start out in the simulator before flying to Mexico for FP1 as well as providing race weekend support, staying on for a 2026 Pirelli tyre test on the Wednesday post-race and then jetting back to Brackley to work in the simulator until late on Thursday evening.\n“That's sort of how we work in Formula 1 – to any normal person, that would seem insane, but that's the kind of things in F1 you have to do to get the maximum performance on track,” says Vesti.\nYet such a process brings rewards, as the Danish driver explains: “Sometimes we start in the simulator at 10 o'clock in the evening, and finish at eight or nine in the morning, and it's very demanding on the mind and body to do these kind of sessions.\n“But when you then see results on track, and you see that you've made a step forward, it's very rewarding, and you can tell the whole team is appreciating the work that the sim team and myself are putting in, and that's a good feeling for sure. That's why we do it, and that's why we work so hard to achieve that.”\nSuch scheduling will no longer be a shock to Vesti, whose impressive junior career saw him join the Mercedes Junior Programme back in 2021 before making the step up to the reserve role in 2024, off the back of taking the runner-up spot in the 2023 Formula 2 championship.\nOne of F1’s recent batch of rookies, Gabriel Bortoleto , has admitted that adjusting to working alongside a much larger team in the top echelon has been one of his “biggest challenges” in his maiden season. Does Vesti feel that his reserve role has offered him an earlier opportunity to adapt?\n“Yeah. When you're in F2 or F3, you're working with two or three people at maximum in your team,” he responds. “It's a very small team, so you know everyone very well. You know everyone's procedures and how they work.\n“When you make the step towards a Formula 1 team – so that can be even just an FP1 – you have an army of engineers, like 50 engineers, that would want information from you, and also you need to ask the right questions to the right people, and that's a huge challenge when you come from F2.\n“That's something Kimi this year has had to get used to pretty quickly, and it's something I've been learning over the past few years with Mercedes.”\nAntonelli, of course, is another young driver to have made the step up to Formula 1 in 2025. Has seeing this wave of youngsters being given an opportunity acted as inspiration for Vesti when it comes to his own next steps?\n“Yeah, absolutely,” the Danish driver – whose past accolades include winning the inaugural Formula Regional European Championship in 2019, as well as collecting victories in each of his two F3 and F2 seasons – concedes.\n“Obviously, initially, seeing all the rookies getting the chance was quite frustrating from my side. I want to be in an F1 seat – it's always been my dream to be a Formula 1 driver.\n“But when that frustration left the body quite quickly, I saw it as an opportunity, because the young drivers are showing how strong the transition from F2 to F1 can be. I would say all are doing a fantastic job and probably exceeded most of the expectations.\n“And that makes my case better when I go and speak to teams about a possible seat, because I've had seven race wins in Formula 2 and I know what I can achieve. Seeing Kimi and other young drivers definitely helps me to believe that there is a seat for me.”\nSupport from Denmark and life in SportsCars\nAs has been the case for the rookies, Vesti recognises that there has been “a lot of learning” on his own path to this point of his career, a stage in which he now feels “very integrated” with the team as he continues to work closely with Russell and Antonelli. The Dane also pays tribute to boss Toto Wolff , who he credits as being a “huge part of my career”.\nIt marks the latest step in a journey that started when the young Vesti developed a passion for karting as a child, as he recalls: “My dad used to be a driver, and he was working three jobs to race on the weekends.\n“He never really made it to be a professional driver, but he always had such a passion for cars and racing. I think on the exact date that I turned eight years old, I was allowed to get a go-kart and that's where it all began.\n“I used to watch F1 with my brothers and my dad and I got into go-karts, and it very quickly got quite serious, fighting for championships quite early on. I've never really looked back since then, just been loving living my dream, and I love what I’ve been doing.”\nVesti is of course one of only a small number of drivers from Denmark to get behind the wheel of an F1 car; indeed, only four Danes have competed in a Grand Prix, the most recent – and experienced – being Kevin Magnussen .\nThe country might be small – with a population of around six million people – but Vesti very much feels the support from his homeland.\n“It's quite amazing to see how many great racing drivers we have coming from such a small country,” he says. “There is a good passion for racing in Denmark, and I definitely feel that support.\n“Also my investors, who have been supporting my career through F3, F2, towards F1, it's been amazing to have that support, and to be fighting for the same dream.”\nThat dream is clearly never far from Vesti’s mind, voicing his excitement about the work he has carried out for Mercedes in preparation for 2026’s sweeping regulation changes as he explains: “It's been new things that we've been discovering that no one really knew before we discovered it in the sim, and that's been a fun journey.”\nAlongside his duties for the Silver Arrows – who will field an unchanged line-up of Russell and Antonelli in 2026 – Vesti will enter into his third season in the IMSA SportsCar Championship, teaming up with Jack Aitken and Earl Bamber for a second campaign in the #31 Whelen Cadillac off the back of collecting two races wins in 2025.\nWhile endurance racing might be a very different beast to Formula 1, Vesti believes that this venture can only benefit his work with Mercedes.\n“I'm a single seater by heart – I've been my whole career, so changing to SportsCars has been definitely quite a challenge,” he admits. “It is a different car. There is lots of different set-up changes and tools that I'm not used to.\n“But it's been a big learning curve, and I've had amazing team mates with Jack Aitken and Earl Bamber, who have been very experienced. Having back-to-back race wins at the end of the 2025 season was quite special, and it's something I'm looking to build on for 2026.\n“Driving this SportsCar, yes, it's not a Formula 1 car, but it massively helps me to jump into the F1 car, that I have that driving experience of new tyres and all those kind of things, so I'm happy to be doing that.”\nVesti on his ‘plan’ to reach F1\nFormula 1 might be heading into its winter break, but there is still plenty to keep Vesti occupied in the weeks and months ahead. After getting behind the wheel as part of the end-of-season test in Abu Dhabi – where he logged a sizeable 145 laps – the Dane has more commitments coming up.\nThe departure of fellow reserve driver Valtteri Bottas – who will make his return to the grid with Cadillac in 2026 – also looks likely to open up further opportunities for Vesti going forward.\n“There will still be lots of sim days to do until the end of the year,” he explains. “We are probably in the most important time right now, getting the 2026 car ready. January is coming up pretty quickly, and the car needs to be ready for that Barcelona test, which is exciting. I can feel the whole team is very motivated to do that, so that's a cool project.\n“And of course, with Valtteri going to race in F1 next year, it opens up a gap for me as reserve driver, and I'm excited to further that role and continue building on this great relationship I have with Mercedes, and just continue my steps towards a Formula 1 seat.”\nWhich begs the question – does Vesti have a timescale in mind for making that F1 dream happen?\n“Well, the short answer is as soon as possible,” he smiles. “But I'm also a realistic person and, looking into the 2027 season, I think that there could be some changes in F1.\n“Obviously most teams have secured drivers for 2025 and 2026 to have a smooth transition into the new cars, but the new regulations are very different, and the cars are very different to drive. So I'm sure there'll be drivers enjoying it, but there will also be some drivers who struggle with the new cars, and hopefully that opens up a gap for me.\n“But I'm very process orientated – I focus on here and now, how I can make a difference to the team and how I can showcase my talent to the teams around, and that's my plan to how I'll get into Formula 1.”"}

Hold your head up high.”\nVerstappen was heard to say in response: “We showed them one final time who’s boss! Congrats guys, what a comeback in our second half of the season. We can be really, really proud of that so don’t be too disappointed. I’m definitely not disappointed. I’m really proud of everyone to never give up.”\nAfter the race, Verstappen reflected further on what his relationship with Lambiase means to him, particularly after an eventful season of highs and lows.\n“It’s been an emotional year,” the 28-year-old explained. “Forget about the results this year. I also don’t want to go too much into detail, but it’s been tough. But I’m very happy to be able to work with someone that passionate.\n“Of course, he is my race engineer, but I see him as my friend. We have lived through so many emotional things together and fantastic achievements. I’m sure he was a bit emotional after the flag.\n“So, I’m really looking forward to leaving here and catching up with him because it’s not been easy at times for him.\n\"I’m just very proud to be able to work with someone that good.

I certainly could have done, and maybe I would need to do more of that in the future. But did I need to do it this year? Is that the way I want to go racing? Is that me? It's not.\n“And I'm sure if you compare me, if that’s what you wanna do, to all the champions: have I been as aggressive as them at times? No. Have I been as daring as them at times? No. But did I do just what I needed to do to win the World Championship?\n“Did I perform consistently? Did I perform when I needed to under the most pressure? Post-Zandvoort, did I come back in the way I had to? Did I have three, four weekends of great results? I did. And I performed when I needed to perform to win the World Championship this season. And in the end, that’s what I needed to do. That’s all I needed to do.”\nNorris acknowledged that there were certain moments during the season that he would approach differently in hindsight – including his collision with Piastri at the Canadian Grand Prix – but the McLaren racer added that he believes he has improved as a driver since the campaign kicked off in Australia back in March.\n“Of course, I’ll learn from everything,” he admitted. “Like I said, moments I wish I could go back on and I feel bad for, like Montreal and things like that, I embarrassed myself. But I wish I could go back and change some things.\n“Plenty of moments to learn from. I feel like I'm a better driver now, certainly, than I was at the beginning of the season. But everyone’s going to do it.\n“And when I’m racing against Max, a four-time World Champion, when I’m racing against Oscar, a guy who at some point in the future will probably beat me and be a World Champion, I’m performing, and I’m having to perform against the best in the world. I look forward to plenty more times like that.\n“I need to understand what I can do better, how can I do better, how can I perform more consistently against them and learn from them? And I feel like I did that this year, and I've got to do that even more next year if I want to retain what we've been able to achieve this year.”"}

If I buy into it, it bothers me, for sure, but that’s where I am fortunate I have good people around me that I love, that I trust, and I put my attention and value their opinions.\n\"I try and live in my world, not the world in that sense. There’s always going to be criticism. People are very short-minded. You have a couple of good races, you’re great. You have a couple of bad ones, you suck.\n\"That’s never going to change. That’s why being surrounded by important people and valuing the opinion of people that you care about, that you value. That you really know, their opinion is what matters. Don’t take criticism from someone you wouldn’t take advice from.”\nStroll has largely settled into the midfield with some strong performances, amassing three podiums and one pole position in his career so far, but he has recently struggled to maximise Aston Martin’s pace after they chose to prioritise their 2026 challenger as he finished this season in P16 with 33 points.\nWhile his father is still the team’s Executive Chairman, there have been a host of changes in recent years, including new state-of-the-art facilities and legendary designer Adrian Newey stepping into the Team Principal role from next season.\nThere are hopes that they can return to fighting at the front of the pack, but the 27-year-old outlined how his rollercoaster career has helped him feel prepared for every eventuality, whether that’s competing for podiums or trying to break into the points.\n\"We can talk about the podiums and the pole, but let's talk about the losses,” Stroll continued. “I think that's where you learn the most about yourself to grow from those tough moments. I think that's where you really grow as a person, as an athlete, as a driver, from those struggles.\n\"I want every day to be great and perfect, but that's just not the reality of sport. In sports, in anything in life that you pursue, there's going to be those highs and those lows.\n“You have to accept that before you even go into it. Before every season, I think to myself, 'There's going to be good days and bad days and I have to accept that now.'\n\"We all love the champagne celebrations.

An eventful season for Norris has also brought with it some fascinating statistics – and we’ve rounded up some of the key numbers below…\n-- 0.698 --\nThe smallest winning margin in seconds of all of Norris ’ victories, with this one occurring during his fifth triumph of the campaign in Hungary.\nA one-stop strategy had helped Norris to get into the lead of Round 14 on the calendar, having lined up behind Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc and the other McLaren of Oscar Piastri . However, a charging Piastri started to hunt Norris down during the latter stages, setting up a thrilling end to the race .\nWhile he made a couple of attempts to overtake, Piastri ultimately could not find a way past his team mate – but crossed the line a mere 0.698s behind.\n-- 2 --\nThe number of points by which Norris took the Drivers’ Championship ahead of closest rival Max Verstappen .\nAfter retaking the lead of the standings following the Mexico City Grand Prix, Norris further strengthened his advantage to 24 points over Piastri at the next round in Sao Paulo. Verstappen, meanwhile, was 49 points adrift at this stage.\nHowever, a run of victories for the Dutchman – coupled with some trickier weekends for McLaren – saw him overtake Piastri for second following the penultimate round in Qatar, putting him only 12 points away from Norris for the finale. Another triumph for Verstappen in Abu Dhabi gave him a further 25 points – but Norris just clung on to win the title, ending the season only two points clear of the Red Bull man.\n-- 6 --\nFastest laps achieved by Norris across the season.\nA rule introduced in 2019 saw the driver that scored the fastest lap of the race awarded an additional point. While this was scrapped ahead of the 2025 campaign, setting the quickest time is still something of an accolade.\nNorris racked up six fastest laps during his title-winning season, with his first coming during his victory at the first race of the championship in Australia while his last occurred at the Italian Grand Prix in September.\n-- 7 --\nNorris’ total number of wins – and pole positions – from the 24-race campaign.\nSeven appears to be the magic number for both Norris and team mate Piastri in 2025; incredibly, each driver claimed seven race victories each, as well as both racking up the same number of poles.\nWhile the majority of Piastri’s triumphs took place during the first half of the year, Norris’ were slightly more evenly spread, having stood on the top step of the podium in Australia (Round 1), Monaco (Round 8), Austria (Round 11), Great Britain (Round 12), Hungary (Round 14), Mexico (Round 20) and Sao Paulo (Round 21).\n-- 8 --\nThe number of race weekends where Norris arrived as the championship leader.\nAs touched on above, Norris kicked off the season in style by winning the Australian Grand Prix, meaning that he took an early lead in the Drivers’ Championship standings. From there the Briton continued to head the table – until Piastri overtook him after Round 5 in Jeddah.\nDespite the Australian remaining ahead of the pack for much of the campaign, a strong run for Norris saw the 26-year-old retake the P1 spot thanks to a dominant victory at Round 20 in Mexico – and the rest is history...\n-- 13 --\nHow many times Norris beat Piastri in the intra-team heads-to-heads.\nIn terms of Qualifying trim for the season, Norris narrowly outscores his team mate by 13-11. As mentioned above, both drivers took seven pole positions – but Norris more frequently placed ahead across the campaign as a whole.\nThe race day head-to-head between the two looks very similar, with Norris again just edging it by 13-10 (not including the Las Vegas Grand Prix, in which both McLaren cars were disqualified for a technical infringement).\n-- 17 --\nNumber of years since McLaren last had a Drivers’ Champion prior to Norris’ success.\nWhen the papaya squad won the Teams’ Championship in 2024, it marked the end of a long wait to return to title glory , with their last triumph having occurred back in 1998. Their most recent Drivers’ title, meanwhile, had been won by Lewis Hamilton in 2008.\nThis year McLaren did the double, wrapping up the Teams’ crown early in Singapore before Norris brought home a long-awaited Drivers’ Championship at the finale, ending the 17-year dry spell since Hamilton’s success.\n-- 18 --\nThe number of times that Norris stood on the podium in 2025.\nAlong with his aforementioned seven wins, the new World Champion also crossed the line in second on eight occasions, as well as taking third place three times – one of which being his crucial title-sealing result in Abu Dhabi.\nWith there being a total of 24 races on the calendar this year, this statistic means that only six of these ended with Norris finishing off the rostrum; two being a DNF (in Canada and the Netherlands), one a DSQ (in Las Vegas), while his other non-podium finishes were a P4 in Saudi Arabia, seventh place in Azerbaijan and another fourth at the penultimate event in Qatar.\n-- 30.324 --\nThe largest winning margin in seconds from Norris’ season, achieved during his dominant victory in Mexico City .\nArriving into the weekend at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, the British driver had been without a P1 finish since the Hungarian Grand Prix almost three months earlier – but he soon boosted his chances of changing that statistic by grabbing a stunning pole position in Qualifying.\nFrom thereon Norris raced to a lights-to-flag triumph, crossing the line with a whopping lead of 30.324s over Leclerc in second place.\n-- 35 --\nThe number World Champion that Norris becomes in Formula 1 history.\nPrior to the 2025 campaign, 34 drivers had achieved the dream of winning the title in the top echelon of motorsport; from the very first won by Giuseppe ‘Nino’ Farina in 1950, through to the four in a row scored by Verstappen between 2021 and 2024.\nNorris’ win means that he becomes the 35th on the list of F1 World Champions – and he’ll doubtless be keen to add more than one championship victory next to his name in the future.\n-- 423 --\nTotal number of points scored by Norris by the end of the season.\nEntering into 2025, the highest number of points available to a driver stood at 648 – but to achieve this would require victory in all 24 races plus the six Sprints.\nNorris ended the campaign with a final total of 423, meaning that he scored 65.3% of the points on offer."}

Mercedes ’ George Russell is the only other driver to triumph, having done so on two occasions.\nThe spread of those wins for the title contenders, however, looks somewhat different. After kicking off the campaign with P1 in the Australian Grand Prix, Norris’ next victory did not arrive until Round 8 in Monaco, before the Briton got into his stride as the season progressed by sealing a further five victories.\nPiastri, meanwhile, collected the majority of his successes earlier in the year, and he remains the only driver to score a hat-trick (achieved across Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Miami). His most recent first place in a Grand Prix came at Round 15 in the Netherlands.\nVerstappen is perhaps the most fascinating example here, however. The Dutchman snatched two wins in the first half of the campaign (at Suzuka and Imola respectively), but a dip in performance for the team resulted in him slipping backwards in the fight at the front.\nBut a resurgent second half of the season saw the four-time World Champion embark on a stunning run, claiming five wins since his triumph at Round 16 in Italy. Now just one more all-important victory is up for grabs – but who will seal what could be a title-deciding win?\nPole positions\nNorris – 7 Verstappen – 7 Piastri – 6\nOnce again, the championship hopefuls are practically on equal terms here, with Norris and Verstappen each claiming seven pole positions in 2025 while Piastri is only one down with a total of six. The other drivers to start from the front slot of the grid have been Russell (twice) and Charles Leclerc (once).\nIn terms of the success rate from these poles, Norris has converted five into a victory, while Verstappen and Piastri have each done so on four occasions.\nAs is the case with wins, most of Piastri’s pole positions were achieved in the first half of the campaign – with the exception of Qatar. For Norris and Verstappen, the P1 slots have been more evenly spread through the season.\nPodiums\nNorris – 17 Verstappen – 14 Piastri – 15\nChampionship leader Norris has the most rostrums under his belt, having taken to the podium 17 times. Two of the occasions where he did not finish within the top three were due to retirements, while his P2 in Las Vegas was nullified when both McLaren cars were disqualified for a technical infringement.\nPiastri has so far scored a total of 15 podiums through the season. Across the first 16 rounds, the Australian notably crossed the line with a top-three result at 14 of these races. However, a trickier run recently saw him finish off the rostrum at six weekends in a row before making his return with his second place in Qatar.\nVerstappen’s tally is only one behind, the Red Bull driver having achieved 14 trips to the podium in 2025 – half of which have been victories. Since the campaign resumed in Zandvoort following its summer break, Verstappen has not finished outside of the top-three, with his current run standing at nine rostrums in a row.\nSprint wins\nNorris – 2 Verstappen – 2 Piastri – 1\nWhen it comes to the six Sprint events held in 2025, Norris, Verstappen and Piastri are responsible for all but one triumph – the exception being Lewis Hamilton ’s win for Ferrari at the season’s first 100km dash in China.\nNorris triumphed in Miami and Sao Paulo, while Verstappen took the spoils at Spa-Francorchamps and the Circuit of The Americas – the latter proving a nightmare outing for McLaren, with both cars eliminated in a Lap 1 melee .\nPiastri, meanwhile, had to wait until Qatar for his Sprint success, the Australian converting pole into a win as he previously did in the same event back in 2023.\nPoints deficits\nAs these numbers have alluded to, the Drivers’ Championship standings have changed quite dramatically throughout the season. Norris initially held the lead until Round 5 in Saudi Arabia, where Piastri took over; at this early stage of the season, the Australian led by 10 points from Norris and 12 from Verstappen.\nNorris’ retirement in Canada – after colliding with Piastri – saw the gap between the team mates open up to 22 points, with Verstappen 43 points adrift of Piastri. And after Round 15 in Zandvoort – in which Norris retired due to a mechanical issue and Piastri scored his most recent Grand Prix win to date – the latter was 34 points ahead of Norris and a whopping 104 points clear of Verstappen.\nBut a tough run for Piastri – coupled with an impressive resurgence for Verstappen – saw the margins close. Victory for Norris at Round 20 in Mexico saw the British racer retake the championship lead from Piastri, with Verstappen then only 36 points behind the leader.\nA double disqualification for McLaren in Las Vegas then put Verstappen on equal points with Piastri, meaning both were 24 points away from Norris – and the papaya squad’s backfired strategy in Qatar resulted in Verstappen leapfrogging Piastri to now sit just 12 points adrift of Norris. Piastri, meanwhile, remains in contention 16 points behind his team mate.\nThe points deficits might have ebbed and flowed throughout the campaign, but the numbers that matter the most are those that will play out when the chequered flag falls in Abu Dhabi…"}

It should be very tight.\"\nPiastri trails Norris by 16 points and is an outsider for the title, but Abu Dhabi has notably produced  climatic title showdowns, with Sebastian Vettel securing his maiden crown in 2010 despite trailing team mate Mark Webber and Fernando Alonso in the points.\n\"I think there are some similarities, for sure,\" said Alonso when asked to compare his 2010 title bid with the current season.\n\"For your interest, in 2010 the best car won. I think the biggest question you all have is who is the favourite, who is going to win on Sunday?\n\"Who knows? This is F1, anything can happen, as we saw last week [in Qatar]. When you have the best car it always helps, and I think McLaren, they have the best car and they have two of the three [drivers]. They should win in a normal race.\"\nA late Safety Car in the 2021 edition gave Verstappen the chance to claim his maiden title, while a Safety Car at the previous race in Qatar and a strategic error by McLaren again opened the door for Verstappen.\nWilliams' Carlos Sainz is hopeful for a clean race in the title-decider, with pure pace deciding the outcome.\n\"I only wish them the best, I wish the best one to win,\" he said.\n\"My preference is no luck involved, so no Safety Cars or red flags at the wrong time for any of them, because that will feel for sure heartbreaking as a driver.\n\"I just want a clean weekend and just let the best guy win. I think obviously Lando is favourite going into it because he needs the top three and it's a good track for McLaren and him.\""}

But on this occasion, George Russell managed to split the pair and relegate Norris to P3, leaving him with the challenge of passing both drivers in the 19-lap Sprint.\nOne contributing factor leading to the Standings leader missing out on the top spot by over two tenths was an error he made in SQ3 – at the final corner, he veered off the track and rattled over the gravel trap, losing time in the process.\nAsked whether he simply couldn’t find the necessary pace or grip, he replied: “No, the pace was there. I just made a mistake in the last corner on my first lap and didn’t put it together.”\nHe also confirmed that a brief tussle with the Williams of Alex Albon, who finished the session in P10, similarly compromised his last lap, concluding “that’s life”.\nWith the Drivers’ Championship on the line, Norris will be aiming to secure maximum points in the Sprint to put him in the best position to end the weekend with a 26-point advantage over Piastri and Max Verstappen , which will see him victorious in the standings.\nHe said: “It would be stupid to not try and win. I’m here to try and win so I’ll see what I can find overnight and see what we can do for tomorrow.\n“It’s impossible to overtake, so I think I’m going to finish P3, but if I can at least get George off the line or something then that’s probably the most I can hope for.”"}

With Pirelli placing a 25-lap limit on each set of tyres at this circuit, almost all of the teams chose to pit and take advantage of the neutralised conditions.\nWhile they lost significantly less time compared to a normal stop and ticked off one of the two mandatory tyre changes, McLaren chose to stay out on track, giving them a much harder job as they had to catch up on two stops in normal racing conditions.\nVerstappen was understandably full of praise for his team’s strategy after the race, saying: “This was an incredible race for us. We made the right call as a team to box under the Safety Car.\n\"That was smart. Of course, I’m super happy to win here and stay in the fight until the end.\n“It was a little bit offset because of it all, but for us I think it was a very strong race on a weekend where it was a little bit tough. We still won the race and that was the most important thing.\n“[McLaren choosing not to pit] was an interesting move. I knew that then of course we had a bit of a gap, but you still need to keep the tyres alive for 25 laps – the wear is very high around here, but luckily it all worked out.”\nThe result came at the end of a challenging weekend for Verstappen as he struggled with bouncing in every session, which contributed to him missing out on a podium in the Sprint.\nHe came back to take P3 in Qualifying, before eventually winning the Grand Prix by nearly eight seconds over Piastri, taking him within 12 points of Norris’ lead in the Standings.\n“Well, it’s all possible now,” he concluded. “We’ll see, I don’t really worry about it too much.”"}

His 12-point lead means that all he needs to do is finish on the podium, whereas Piastri would need multiple things to go wrong for his rivals in order to take victory.\nThey undoubtedly have an advantage by having both drivers starting towards the front of the grid as Verstappen’s departing team mate Yuki Tsunoda , who assisted by giving him a tow in Qualifying, will be much further behind in P10.\nReflecting on the session, Brown told F1 TV : “I feel good. We’ve got a good race car for tomorrow. Get a good start tomorrow, good first lap, things settle in. I think we’ve got a little advantage when it comes to strategy and we’ll see what happens. It’s going to be a nail-biter.\n“I think Lando’s disappointed he didn’t get pole, and Oscar’s disappointed he didn’t get pole. I think there were maybe some little nerves at the start in Q1, but then everything settled down and it was business as usual.\n“Max put in two spectacular laps – he was concerned about the tow that he got from Tsunoda but he didn’t need it the second time around. Hopefully they dialled in a one-lap wonder and they’ll pay the price tomorrow, but I’m not so sure that’s the case.”\nThe prospect of deploying team orders to secure the title has reared its head multiple times going into this weekend – on Thursday’s media day, Norris mentioned that no discussions had taken place, but Brown quickly confirmed that they would be willing to utilise them.\nThey have been a constant sticking point for the Woking outfit over the last two seasons, with their unrelenting focus on fairness occasionally creating tension, such as in Monza when the Australian was asked to let his team mate through after he suffered a slow pit stop.\nNevertheless, Brown appeared confident that their approach will not change for the finale, and extensive conversations about all the possible scenarios that could unfold in the 58-lap race will take place.\nAsked to elaborate on how those necessary talks will take place, he replied: “We’re going to have them tonight and then again in the morning. We’re going to have an initial chat tonight then sleep on it, but it’s all to play for so I think going into tomorrow, it’s the obvious ‘don’t trade any paint’ as they say in NASCAR land.\n“See how the race plays out, and if it becomes apparent that one or the other is in a position where they can or can’t win, then we’ll look at strategy. I think sitting here right now, it’s all to play for. It’s go, go, go.\n“You’ve got two guys going for the championship so I’m sure Oscar’s mindset is ‘I need to win’. If he wins, that takes points off Max which means Lando doesn’t even need to finish third. There are two different mindsets, but the field is so close.\n“I think the minute you’re not fully on it or if you’re too conservative, you’ll get swallowed up by the cars behind because it’s so close. I think it’s kind of business as usual – that’s got to be the approach.\n“Max is a smart racing driver, not only fast, so we’ll be ready for all the different scenarios.”"}

Future roles, stuff like that.\n“So if I ever would make a change, of course, it's a big one for me because this definitely feels like a second family, and that's not easy to replicate, let's say, like that.\n\"The change, if I would ever make one, it's not only because I need a faster F1 car or I need a difference in the environment. There's a lot of things that are around my F1 career and things that I'm doing outside of F1 that all have to come together.\"\nPushed further on whether this means that it was not something he was seriously considering at the time, Verstappen responded: “I'm not going to lie. For sure, there were talks. But at the same time, it was all very friendly and open. Nothing more than that.\"\nVerstappen – who won on his GT3 debut at the Nurburgring Nordschleife in September – also spoke of his desire to continue improving as a driver, adding that he does this by “always trying to look for details, trying to just learn about the car, learn about yourself, do a lot of things also outside of F1.”\n\"I'm driving, of course, a lot of different cars, external which I don't think it hurts you, racing in F1,” the 28-year-old continued. “So, yeah, just trying to make yourself a bit more of a complete driver, a bit more all-round.\""}

The season is set for a thrilling finale this weekend, and on top of the three-way battle there are plenty of other positions to be finalised, and reactions to be given, at the last race of the year in Abu Dhabi.\nTitle permutations and McLaren’s reaction\nA week ago, it was only Lando Norris who could win himself a Drivers’ Championship, but the two other contenders managed to keep themselves in the frame in Qatar, even if there were differing emotions as a result.\nWhat looked set to be an Oscar Piastri victory – likely ahead of Max Verstappen in second and Norris in third – changed on Lap 7 in Qatar when McLaren were the only team not to bring their drivers into the pits during a Safety Car period. With the entire rest of the field doing so, it lost out on race time and the path was clear for a Verstappen victory.\nPiastri still salvaged second but could not challenge Verstappen, while Norris was limited to fourth place behind Carlos Sainz. The upshot of all that was Norris retained his championship lead, but Verstappen moved into second place – 12 points adrift – and Piastri dropped to third, 16 points behind his team mate.\nThe equation for Norris is simple this weekend, as a podium finish will guarantee him the title. Beyond that, it’s easiest to focus on what the other two contenders need to do.\nVerstappen has to finish on the podium – with neither McLaren driver doing so – to have any chance. A win for Verstappen coupled with fourth or lower for Norris will win him the championship, while if the Red Bull driver is second he needs Norris no higher than eighth, or if he’s third then Norris no higher than ninth.\nFor Piastri, a top-two finish is necessary to be in the frame, and a win would be enough as long as Norris doesn’t finish in the top five. If Piastri is second, he will need Norris to be 10th or lower, and Verstappen to not finish on the podium.\nGiven the pace of the McLaren, the title picture still remains firmly in their hands with Norris, but as Team Principal Andrea Stella pointed out on Sunday night, they will need to execute better than they have at the last two races.\nDrivers’ standings after Qatar\nP2 in the Constructors’ Championship\nWhile Mercedes are in control, there remains a chance that Red Bull could still earn second place in the Teams’ Championship off the back of Verstappen’s Drivers’ title charge.\nKimi Antonelli’s mistake late on in Qatar drew misguided questions from Red Bull for a spell after the race, as the Italian rookie lost a position to Norris. Red Bull have since said they “sincerely regret” comments that the move could have been intentional, after Antonelli received online abuse.\nThe impact of the error that cost Antonelli fourth place was not only two extra points for Norris, but two fewer for Mercedes in their fight against Red Bull for second in the standings. Verstappen’s win meant Red Bull closed in by seven points on Sunday, and sit 33 adrift heading into the final round.\nThere are a maximum of 43 points on offer, so Mercedes simply need to add 11 points of their own to cement second place, but given a strong overall showing from Yuki Tsunoda in Qatar – where he scored points in both the Sprint and Grand Prix – it’s not beyond the realms of possibility that Red Bull could pick up enough points to put pressure on if Verstappen is able to win the race.\nOther positions to be decided\nThe final race weekend of the season always brings clarity on the final results, but sometimes there are more positions decided than is the case this year.\nIn the Drivers’ Championship , Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Antonelli are separated by just two points for sixth place, while Alex Albon in eighth could still theoretically be overtaken by any one of four drivers in Carlos Sainz, Isack Hadjar, Nico Hulkenberg or Fernando Alonso.\nBelow them, everyone is also in a position that could change – albeit only a win would move Franco Colapinto up in the standings – with Oliver Bearman in 13th theoretically able to climb as high as ninth or drop as low as 19th.\nBut the final Teams’ Championship positions are deemed more important this weekend, given the extra prize money that comes with each place a team gains.\nFerrari are guaranteed to finish fourth and Williams fifth, but sixth is still up for grabs, with Racing Bulls 12 points ahead of Aston Martin. Haas in eighth (19 points behind Racing Bulls) and Sauber in ninth (24 adrift) can also both technically climb as high as sixth, though they would need big results to do so.\nHadjar’s Red Bull promotion\nIf Racing Bulls are able to hold onto the sixth place they currently occupy, they will end the year on a high and say goodbye to one of the stars of the season as Isack Hadjar prepares to move up to Red Bull in 2026 .\nRed Bull have confirmed the talented Frenchman will partner Max Verstappen next season, with the rookie having impressed in a debut year that featured a podium in Zandvoort and two other top-six finishes – so far at least – as he currently sits 10th in the Drivers’ standings.\nThe second Red Bull seat has been a difficult one to occupy in recent seasons, with Sergio Perez replaced 12 months ago, Liam Lawson only getting two races with the team at the start of this year, and then Yuki Tsunoda managing just one top-six finish of his own in that car.\nIt will be an emotional weekend for Tsunoda as he loses his race seat for next year and becomes reserve at Red Bull, with Arvid Lindblad a new name on the grid next season at Racing Bulls alongside Liam Lawson.\nThe British-Swedish driver steps up after just one year in F2 – where he currently sits sixth in the championship with two wins to his name – and will continue the Red Bull tradition of providing opportunities to young talents.\nOne race away from two new names\nAbu Dhabi marks the final race of the ground effect era cars that were introduced in 2022, with an emphasis on trying to create impressive aerodynamic performance from the floor while also making it easier to follow another car more closely.\nIt has been a very fruitful era for Red Bull and Max Verstappen, but has also seen the return of McLaren as a force at the front of the field, while Ferrari came close to a Teams’ Championship last year and Mercedes have also won races.\nAs the field bunches up towards the end of a regulatory cycle, naturally the small differences in cars make it harder for drivers to overtake. But four teams have won races, and nine of the 10 have stood on the podium across the past three seasons, while every team finished in the top six at some stage this year.\nThe new regulations in 2026 provide the chance for a complete reset of the competitive order, but will also see two new names joining the fray as Audi and Cadillac become part of the grid. Audi are taking over the Sauber team, while Cadillac represent an expansion to 11 constructors, and there promises to be some exciting storylines to follow from both next season.\nWhen the chequered flag drops on Sunday night, there will be just 50 days until the new cars are running for the first time during a private shakedown in Barcelona, and both Audi and Cadillac will be able to say that they will be on the grid for the next race, in Australia on March 8."}

I didn't think I'd cry but I did,” the 26-year-old said. “It's a long journey. First of all I want to say a big thanks to my guys, everyone at McLaren . My parents... I'm not crying. My mum, my dad, they were the ones who supported me since the beginning.\n“It feels amazing. Now I know what Max feels like a little bit, and I want to congratulate Max and Oscar, my two biggest competitors all season. It's been a pleasure to race against both of them, and I've learnt a lot from both of them as well.\n“I've enjoyed it, it's been a long year but we did it and I'm so proud of everyone.”\nReflecting further on how it feels to claim his debut title following a hard-fought campaign, Norris – who arrived in F1 with McLaren in 2019 after joining the squad’s Driver Development Programme two years earlier – added: “It's incredible. Pretty surreal.\n“I've dreamed of this for a long time, everyone does. A lot goes into a season like this, lot of ups, lot of downs, but none of that matters as long as you try and come out on top, and that's what we managed to do with an incredible team.\n“All the boys and girls that I've enjoyed so many moments with. It's not just this year, it's been over the last seven, eight years I've been with McLaren. The last 16, 17 years of my life I've been trying to chase this dream and today we all did it, so I'm pretty happy.”\nSunday’s race at the Yas Marina Circuit was not necessarily all smooth sailing for Norris, who was overtaken by Piastri on Lap 1 and later had to get past the likes of Red Bull ’s Yuki Tsunoda .\nWhen asked how much the World Championship had been on his mind during the Grand Prix – or if he was focused on the moment – the British racer said: “Bit of both. You can't not think of it.\n“I knew it was a long race to the very end, we've seen many times anything in F1 can happen and I just kept pushing until the last two or three laps [where] I could ease it off a bit, but I still wanted to fight to the end.\n“That's what we did, what we had to do this season for Max chasing us the whole way, for Oscar catching up at the end. They certainly didn't make my life easy this year, but I'm happy.”\nNorris also admitted that he had “no idea” that he was under investigation for his move on Tsunoda, to which the stewards subsequently deemed that no further action was required, before adding: “I didn't care, I knew what I did was fine so I had nothing to worry about.\n“I was just trying to enjoy the moment. Not many people in the world, in F1, get to experience what I've experienced this season and this year. I'm happy for everyone more than me. I'm just crazy happy.”\nAs he becomes the 35th Formula 1 World Champion in history, the new title-holder summarised: “It's been a long journey with McLaren.\n\"I've been with them for like nine years, we've been through plenty of crazy difficult times and plenty of good times.\n“For me to feel like I could bring something back to them, it's their first Drivers' [title] in many, many years, I feel like I did my part for the team this year and I'm very proud of myself for that, but I'm even more proud for everyone that I've hugged and made cry.”"}

At one stage, he held an advantage of 34 points over his team mate, but a downturn in performance in later rounds culminated in him dropping to third, finishing 13 points behind Norris.\nThe pair both achieved seven wins, leaving the Australian keen to focus on how much he has improved in just three seasons, and identify how to continue that development to pursue his maiden championship.\nSpeaking after the season finale, he said: “I think, obviously, I would have wished for a slightly different ending, but I think this year I’ve learned a hell of a lot about myself as a race car driver, myself as a person.\n“I think if you had presented this season at the start of the year with the pole positions and the wins and the podiums, I definitely would have been pretty happy with that.\n“And I think even in the tough moments, I’ve learned a lot about myself and how I can be stronger in the future.\n“So, I think, ultimately, there’s a little bit of disappointment, obviously, but I think I can be very proud of the season I’ve had and plenty of lessons to take to the future.”\nAfter claiming his first win at the 2024 Hungarian Grand Prix, Piastri quickly settled into being a title contender in the opening half of this season, taking six victories before the summer break as McLaren became the team to beat.\nHowever, he went on to suffer a run of six rounds without standing on the podium, including a rare crash in Azerbaijan and a tough disqualification for both him and Norris in Las Vegas, which allowed both the Briton and Verstappen to leapfrog Piastri in the standings.\nHe bounced back with a near-perfect weekend in Qatar, before a misjudged strategy call saw him lose out on another win to the Red Bull driver. But ending the year on a relative high with second place in Abu Dhabi helped him focus on taking the positives from the rollercoaster season.\n“When I look at this season compared to my first two years in F1, this year has been head and shoulders above the first two,” he said. “Ultimately, whilst the end result is not quite what I wanted, there’s a lot of optimism and a lot of strength that I’ve gained from proving to myself what I can achieve through this season.\n“Those are the kinds of things that are not necessarily tied to results. So I think for me, I can definitely take that forward into the future. It’s only my third attempt at this in F1. Hopefully, I’ve got plenty more to go, but there are definitely lessons from this year that will only make me stronger.\n“There’ve definitely been lessons directly to do with how I drive the car, how I can be better in different conditions, and just become a better all-round driver. There have also been lessons outside the car – dealing with adversity, dealing with difficult moments.\n“I’ve learned a lot about myself in those kinds of things. So, there have been lessons both in and out of the car that will definitely help me for the future.”"}

There’s been no title double in Formula 3 and Formula 2, or even a realistic challenge for either of those crowns.\nHis CV comprises a single season securing fourth place with Prema Racing in the 2024 Formula 3 Championship, and this season he secured two wins in Formula 2 where he sits in sixth position with two races of the campaign to go.\nThis season Lindblad was placed with the same Campos team as 2025 F1 rookie Isack Hadjar , giving Red Bull a trusted outfit to develop their young driver.\nAnd it feels like the teenage racer has driven with the same confidence of his predecessor: trusting that promotion was assured if he met his set objectives.\nIn days of old, fourth and sixth place championship finishes would not have been enough for the most cut throat team in F1, but in recent times things have changed.\nThat Lindblad’s promotion feels so similar to Hadjar’s is a testament to head of the programme Guillaume Rocquelin, who has brought wisdom to a set up which had started to drift.\nIncredibly, the Faenza team which Lindblad is joining had once signed Brendon Hartley after the New Zealander sent Helmut Marko a text asking if they had any drives going.\nSimilarly they re-signed Alex Albon in 2019 after dropping him from the programme years previously. Albon went from no F1 drive in November 2018 to Max Verstappen’s team mate by August 2019. There was a lack of rhyme or reason to the moves.\nSuch haphazard recruitment has diminished in recent times. Rocquelin takes a wider view, focusing on evidence of improvement rather than just pure results.\nThis stands in sharp contrast to the 2010’s era where Pierre Gasly was told “win GP2 and you’ll be promoted to F1” only to be told he hadn’t won the title convincingly enough and he was sent for an extra year of junior racing in Japan.\nNone of this context is to diminish Lindblad’s talent behind the wheel because it is sizeable. But the young charger has benefited from Red Bull modernising their approach.\nSo what can Racing Bulls expect from their new driver?\nIn his younger years Lindblad claimed multiple karting titles and the prestigious Formula 4 Macau street race victory, and after Red Bull identified him in their words as a “generational talent” they signed him at 14 years of age.\nThat put Lindblad on a steep learning curve each year but it’s a path he’s thrived on. Under the mentorship of F2 race winner and FIA Formula E champion Oliver Rowland, Lindblad believes the Yorkshireman – a hugely naturally talented driver in his own right – has helped him understand how to be competitive when jumping through the motorsport pyramid in consecutive years.\n“To have someone with that knowledge and capability, helping to guide me, has been instrumental to my transition, because it is a massive step,” he said last year.\nLindblad’s drive at Silverstone’s F3 Feature race last year was a standout performance. At a circuit he’d somehow never driven before he mastered the greasy conditions on slick tyres to take victory.\nWinning in low grip conditions never goes unnoticed higher up the ladder, and to sweep an F3 weekend in an ultra-competitive 30-car championship was hugely impressive.\nAfter many TPC (Testing of Previous Cars) tests in two-year-old F1 machinery showed Racing Bulls he had the foundation for Formula 1, Red Bull were further delighted by FP1 runs in Silverstone and Mexico City – especially the latter which saw Lindblad use different tyre compounds effectively and outpace regular driver Yuki Tsunoda with a fine run to P6.\nAffable in the paddock and well liked by team personnel, Lindblad once had the confidence to sidle up to Lando Norris and proclaim “I want you to remember me, I’ll see you in five years”.\nIn March 2026 he will deliver on his promise and will share the grid with the British driver."}

The McLaren driver grips the microphone with both hands, still smiling and looks over to me itching to start the interview. It's not often that happens, but this is no ordinary time.\nNorris is buzzing. Even if he's soaked head to toe in a combination of sweat and champagne, there's nothing that is going to harsh his buzz. This is his moment. The one he's worked all his life for.\nWhen I call him World Champion again, he giggles and that smile gets even bigger as he grips the microphone tighter. It may have been around two hours since the race had finished – and he may have done a round of the TV pen talking to all the broadcasters and then a long Champion's Press Conference with the media before celebrating with his team in the garage – but it's clear it hasn't sunk in yet. Not by a long shot.\n\"It just takes a little time to acknowledge what we've all achieved,\" he says. \"I have achieved my dream, that little boy's dream.\n\"Yeah, me as a six-year-old, seeing it on TV, thinking, I want to do that, and now I'm here and achieving it. This is crazy. So I'll always have to start by saying a big thanks to my parents, my mum, my dad, my brother, my sisters, the people who have been there since day one. But boy, yeah, a hell of a journey.\n\"Many years with McLaren, ups, downs. But this year I managed to say thank you for all of it in one big go, with the constructors' [crown] and with the drivers' [title]. I don't know when it's really going to sink in.\n\"If you want the truth, I just went to the toilet. It's the first time I've just been a little bit alone, nice and peaceful and quiet. And I was like, 'oh, I did it, I did it, I did it!'\n\"Yeah, so it is truly amazing to finally get to feel what it's like, to feel on top of the world for a few moments, and also just to get to give back to everyone that's put so much into me. It started with my parents, but also my engineers, my mechanics, everyone back in the factory. They worked so, so hard to achieve this kind of thing.\n\"Today, instead of words of saying thank you, as much as I'll still say thank you in words, the action of a championship means so much more than that. And I thank them to the world.\"\n'I'm such a lucky person. I know I am'\nNorris is no stranger to long answers in interviews, whether he's had a good day or not. It's always been his way to front up to things, to explain things and to be honest.\nOn winning the championship, those answers only got longer, because he was not only eager to highlight that it was a team effort – which includes all those who have helped him along the way – but because the craziness of what he had just achieved meant there was so much swirling around in his head, it was difficult to articulate anything succinctly. It was sensory overload.\nThe first people he embraced were his mum and dad, who stood proudly in parc ferme waiting to give their son a squeeze. \"It's quite simple,\" he says. \"I wouldn't be here without them. I wouldn't have had the chance to live my dream, to live an incredible life that I have.\n\"I'm such a lucky person. I know I am. And I think that's also why I understand that. I understand what a lucky person I am to have been given that opportunity to get to enjoy my life at such a young age, karting, travelling the world, doing what I do.\n\"I get to now say thank you in the biggest way possible. And I also just get to give back, and it's so hard to do that when you're in my position because you always feel like you're taking, and everyone's behind you, and you're the star.\n\"But I really don't like that aspect of it. I only like the fact that I get to come in and see everyone so happy. That's the craziest feeling in the world, is knowing you can have such a big impact on everyone. Yeah, I mean, to see my mum crying. And my dad. That just shows how much it means to them.\"\n'I had to do a better job than I've ever done before'\nNorris started the season off in the best possible way by winning in Australia but thereafter, it was his team mate Oscar Piastri who assumed control of the title fight as Norris struggled to get comfortable with the car. While Norris found solutions – which helped him win Monaco and his home race at Silverstone for the first time – Piastri had momentum and gradually pulled away as the championship headed towards the summer break.\nWhen Norris pulled off track at Zandvoort while running second, as Piastri clinched victory, he was left sat on the dunes, head in hands, wondering how he was going to overcome a 34-point deficit.\n\"I certainly thought my life was extremely difficult, and it was from that point onward,\" he says of that moment in Zandvoort. \"I had to do a better job than I've ever done before. I had to start winning a lot of races. I had to consistently beat my team mate. I had to consistently beat everyone.\n\"At that point, it felt like a lot. At that point, I could barely beat him on one weekend.\n\"Whether that was on the simulator, here on the track, with my engineers, spending time with them, understanding the difficulties, just going into more depth than ever before, trying to be more efficient, bringing in more people from around, wherever it is, to help me understand myself, help me understand how I can get more out of myself, how I can get more out of the people around me, how we can all work together better as a team.\n\"All of these little things, a lot of little things that no one else gets to see, no one even knows about, apart from me and my team. My team around me that pushes so much to achieve something like today.\n\"It's not something I even need other people to know about or care about, but it's something that I know, like so much effort, so much time, so much work, from my group went into, how can we make Lando a better person, a better driver, how can we get him to win the championship from being 34 points behind?\n\"All of that work paid off and that's what made me so happy at that time, was like, damn, I'm actually doing it, I'm doing what I needed to do. Because one thing is just thinking it or believing it, the next thing is actually going out and doing it. That was my job and I wouldn't have been able to do that without the people around me.\"\nNorris found a way to chip away at Piastri's lead – and then really started to stamp authority on the championship, as his team mate struggled with the car, through commanding victories in Mexico and Brazil.\nBut there would be a further twist as a double disqualification for McLaren in Las Vegas and a strategy blunder in Qatar allowed Norris' friend and four-time world champion Max Verstappen back into the hunt. He trailed by just 12 points heading into the final round in Abu Dhabi.\nNorris didn't let it affect him, though. He had retreated into a bubble after Zandvoort, allowing only his closest confidents in, while also relying on the sage advice of some very successful elite athletes – including four-time World Champion Sebastian Vettel .\n\"I've had some great words and great text messages and conversations with some incredible people, people that have won World Championships in different sports, Lewis and others like Seb. A lot of people don't know I speak to Seb about things.\n\"A lot of these people, [former MotoGP champion Casey] Stoner, who, when I needed it most, sent me that little text message and said 'think of this, believe in yourself, do this, do that', and just help me along.\n\"When you win the championship by two points, I would certainly say having these moments of faith from others around me got me those two points. And therefore, that's why I've got to thank everyone around me because two points is also what you need.\"\nVerstappen and Piastri made Norris' \"life hell\"\nIn defeating Verstappen, Norris has overcome one of the greatest drivers of all time, and in Piastri, he's beaten a driver who for two-thirds of this season looked like he would win his maiden Formula 1 World Championship at a canter. It's an impressive feat.\n\"Max and Oscar, I don't want you to forget about Oscar, they both made my life hell this season,\" he says. \"So much of what I've done is because they give me an ass-whooping every now and then.\n\"I've got to go and question myself after. How did they beat me by so much here? How did they do this corner so much better than me? All these things.\n\"Everyone understands that from Max because he's achieved so much already. He's a four-time World Champion. I honestly believe Max is one of the best you'll ever see in Formula 1. He works hard. He's an incredible driver. He's got everything you need in so many ways. And Oscar is still, let's say, the new kid on the block. He drives like he's been in it for 20 years already. He's also made my life very difficult.\n\"I think as team mates, we've made our lives difficult. That's allowed Max to catch up in the championship and then make both of our lives difficult. But I don't know how I'm going to say thanks to them or credit them or congratulate them. I don't know what really is the correct thing to do or say things.\n\"It's a tricky situation because I want to go out and celebrate with Oscar but it's difficult at the same time because he's your team mate. I know he's going to be thinking of a lot of things right now. I know at some point I'm going to be in his position in the future and I'm going to be thinking the same things and he's probably going to be sat here talking to you.\n\"I've got to give a respect and credit to both Oscar and Max. Max doesn't need it because he already has it but Oscar I do because I think a lot of people already give him the respect he deserves and the credit he deserves but obviously I can't do an interview or I can't do anything without saying a congrats and a thanks and giving credit to them too.\"\nFair play to Norris, he stuck with this 20-minute interview that goes out to broadcasters around the world and while he respected the need to do it, he understandably wanted to leave as soon as he could to go and party with his friends and celebrate his incredible achievement.\nJust over 36 hours later (with some significant partying in between) he was back at track for testing, as preparations began for 2026 and his title defence. Formula 1 waits for no one.\nBut while Norris still had a fair few more engagements, including picking up his World Championship trophy last night , soon he'll get a couple of weeks to detach himself from the day job and start to properly enjoy celebrating and digesting achieving his lifelong dream."}

With the McLaren man needing to finish on the podium to take the title, Leclerc’s presence certainly caused some stress for the papaya team, but when his attempt at an undercut failed, Norris was able to pull away.\nThat left Leclerc a somewhat lonely fourth for the rest of the race, despite brief periods here he was able to close down Norris – but never enough to get back within DRS range of his quarry. While fourth is a decent result, Leclerc was hoping for more not just from the race, but the season as a whole.\n“I gave it everything and our team executed the race perfectly. Unfortunately, P4 was all there was in it for us today,” Leclerc said after the race.\n“I really wanted to finish the season on a high, bringing home a podium for everyone, and I was close to Lando in a few moments of the race, but it was not enough to make a pass.”\nLeclerc was unable to hide his “disappointment” in a season that yielded no Grand Prix wins for Ferrari , although Lewis Hamilton did record one Sprint victory. Leclerc delivered one pole across the season, and seven podiums as he finished fifth in the Drivers’ Championship .\n“I am very disappointed, very disappointed because in general once you are in the heat of the season, race after race, you try and keep your head high. You try and stay motivated, smile and think about the positives.\n“But when the season ends, that’s where the disappointment is getting to me on a season like that. And I just need a few weeks' break, recharge the batteries and go again for next year. But it is the way it is, at least we finish on a slightly more positive note which is a good thing always.\n“But the disappointment of the season is quite big.”\nFerrari finished fourth in the Constructors’ , with their form very hit and miss throughout the season. The good news for the team is that the switch to focus on the 2026 car took place relatively early, meaning resources were diverted and what that cost the Scuderia in 2025 could be made up for with a strong challenge next season.\n“The season has been very tough, true,” added Leclerc. “But there is still a lot of motivation as we think there is a big opportunity next year. So, it is up to us to take that opportunity, and we are working flat-out to achieve that. So, I hope that Ferrari will finally get back on top.”\nLeclerc can at least take heart from out-performing his new team mate, scoring 86 more points than Hamilton across the year as both drivers turn their attention to a new era of F1 cars."}

However, unfortunately it was the only positive of today because the rest has been a struggle, but at least that gives me a little bit of a smile.”\nLeclerc conceded that the team had “not yet” found any answers after reporting slow race pace in FP1.\n“We are trying everything, but unfortunately there’s something that we are missing since two or three races that I don’t quite understand where it’s gone,” he explained. “But we are doing everything in trying to understand that and I hope we can find a solution before tomorrow’s Qualifying.”\nFor now Leclerc admitted that he is somewhat pleased to have completed his last Friday of the year at the wheel of the SF-25, with the eight-time race winner commenting: “I’m kind of happy about that, especially considering how it’s going at the moment, but I just really want to finish on a high.\n“It doesn’t look like it’s going to finish on a high if we continue like that, but I will do my best.”\nLewis Hamilton echoed those sentiments on the other side of the Ferrari garage. When asked for his feelings after the final Friday of the 2025 campaign, the Briton answered: “Thankful! No, I feel okay. I think obviously Arthur did a good job this morning.\n“It’s always cool to watch youngsters come through and do what they do and see them shine. That ultimately puts whoever misses the session on a little bit of back foot, but I did my best to get up to speed as quick as possible, and obviously [I’ve] been faced with quite a difficult balance in this session so we’ve got some work to do.”\nDespite the difficulties, Hamilton – who was 13th on the timesheets in FP2, his sole practice outing of the day – is still hoping for a step forward during the remainder of the weekend.\n“I still have hope and there’s potential in this car,” the seven-time World Champion said. “My question to the guys is like, ‘There are certain issues that we have. These are my problems, help me fix them – what can we do to improve our ride and the bouncing that we have and the understeer?’\n“So if we can fix those going into FP3, then I think we could be in a slightly better position. The first and second sector I was right there – pace-wise it wasn’t so bad, it’s just when I got to the third sector, it was seven tenths, so if I can fix that tomorrow I think we can do better.”"}

He holds the record for the most wins, pole positions, podiums, points, and laps led, along with a stunning seven World Championships. But racing excellence is far from the only string to Hamilton’s bow...\nOver his career, the Briton has earned respect in the fields of fashion, philanthropy, music, film and activism - bringing all of these interests together with his passion for design to produce some iconic helmets. So, to celebrate the Ferrari driver’s 41st birthday, let’s take a look at his glittering career through some of his best lids.\nMcLaren – Years in Yellow\n2007\nDuring his karting days, Hamilton had a Ferrari red helmet, but his father, Anthony, wanted to spot him on track more easily, so they switched to a predominately yellow lid. That yellow has followed Hamilton ever since, debuting it in his maiden F1 season for McLaren in 2007, where he missed out on the title by a single point.\n2008\nHamilton was once again in yellow when he went one better than 2007, taking the 2008 Drivers’ Championship amid a battle with Ferrari’s home favourite Felipe Massa in the season finale at Interlagos .\n2009 British Grand Prix\nSpecial helmets have been a regular feature for Hamilton whenever they’ve been permitted, including this one for his third appearance at Silverstone in 2009. Although Hamilton had a horrid time down in 16th that year, his home track played host to some of his greatest career drives.\n2010 Monaco Grand Prix\nInspired by the casinos of Monaco, this helmet certainly caught the eye in the Principality.\n2011 Indian Grand Prix\nHamilton has frequently referenced his love of music, including this lid paying tribute to the legendary reggae artist Bob Marley.\n2012 Singapore Grand Prix\nAlthough the ‘Lion of Singapore’ was a title given to Sebastian Vettel , Hamilton certainly has had his moments around the original night race. His helmet featured Singapore’s mascot on the top, but despite taking pole position around Marina Bay, his gearbox failed on Lap 1 to end his weekend.\n2012 United States Grand Prix\nA special design for a special race, as Hamilton won the first race at the Circuit of The Americas donning the US flag.\nMercedes 2013-2019 – Red, White and Championships\n2013\nTaking the gamble to move to Mercedes was a masterstroke from Hamilton, but he had to endure a slower 2013 before the wins started flowing. The Briton kept a similar yellow design, but the first signs of red on his helmet started to appear.\n2013 Monaco Grand Prix\nThe now Monaco resident wore an eye-catching design in 2013, featuring then-girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger and the beloved Roscoe.\n2014\nA new era of cars brought a new era of helmets, as the Briton's fortunes reached new heights - he would go on to win six of the next seven World Championships. Red and white became a regular feature for half a decade, while the words ‘Still I Rise’ from poet Maya Angelou were emblazoned on the back.\n2015\nHelmet creativity took a hit in 2015 after the FIA introduced rules to make drivers more recognisable by having similar or identical designs throughout the season. Fans were getting used to the new red and white as Hamilton kept a similar design from 2014, adding two stars to represent his two titles that he’d claimed at the time.\n2016\nTwo stars became three after his 2015 triumph, as Hamilton stuck to his ‘candy apple’ red design, but this helmet didn’t prove to be so fruitful. An engine failure in Malaysia combined with superb consistency from Rosberg meant the German secured his first and only title at the season finale in Yas Marina.\n2017\nHamilton decided to switch it up after his 2016 Championship heartbreak, hosting a competition for fans to design his new helmet for the year. In the end, the Brazilian Rai Caldato won, with his effort paying tribute to Hamilton’s hero Ayrton Senna . The design featured blue, green and yellow stripes - the Brazilian colours - while keeping some of the ‘candy apple’ red that had featured for years.\n2018\nAnother year of dominance in his W09 Mercedes gave Hamilton a Fangio -equalling fifth Championship, and it was time for the Briton to celebrate. Hamilton went all out for the season finale in Abu Dhabi, putting the number 1 on his car for the first time and wearing a special golden lid to mark the occasion.\n2019\nThe Hamilton and Mercedes partnership was simply unstoppable in the turbo-hybrid era, producing a stellar season featuring 11 wins and 17 podiums. Hamilton secured his sixth title while wearing a red-heavy design that would be the last of its kind.\n2019 Monaco Grand Prix\nThe late Niki Lauda influenced so many in F1, but perhaps none more so than Hamilton. The Austrian persuaded Hamilton to take a chance on Mercedes back in 2013, so when he passed away in 2019 a week before Monaco, it was only right that the Briton honoured his legacy with a special red design featuring an ‘L’ on the lid. To top it all off, an emotional Hamilton took pole and the win.\nMercedes 2020-2024 – Creativity with Meaning\n2020\nA shortened 2020 season due to the pandemic still produced some iconic moments and designs for Hamilton. The Briton combined his dedication to activism with his creativity to produce a striking purple and black helmet design which spotlighted the ‘Black Lives Matter’ movement . With Mercedes also switching to an all-black livery, Hamilton spent the season pushing hard for equality – and winning as he did it. The W11 was one of the greatest cars ever produced, missing the podium only twice and failing to take pole only once – with Hamilton taking his seventh title after a mesmerising drive in Turkey.\n2021 Qatar Grand Prix\nHamilton’s favourite colour, purple, returned for the 2021 season, but with the rules on helmet designs relaxing, we got some more one-off helmets to marvel at. The Mercedes driver has used the rainbow design a number of times during his career, helping to raise awareness for the Pride movement.\n2021 British Grand Prix\nAn artist collaboration in 2021 produced a unique helmet for Hamilton’s home race. ‘Mad Dog Jones’ added the names of Silverstone's famous corners, as well as a recycling sign, a Black Lives Matter logo, and Maya Angelou’s famous words.\n2022\nThe purple and black era came to an end in 2022, coinciding with the regulation change that hurt Mercedes’ form. Hamilton opted to return to his yellow roots, saying that he wanted to approach the season with the same “dedication, drive and passion” as his karting days.\n2023 Japanese Grand Prix\nHamilton combined his favourites of purple and yellow for his penultimate season with Mercedes, but another artist collaboration for Suzuka produced his most spectacular lid to date. Hajime Sorayama produced the metallic helmet with an illuminated visor – it was impossible to take your eyes off it.\n2024 Brazilian Grand Prix\nAnother slow year meant Hamilton’s quest for a record-breaking eighth title would go on, with 2024 bringing his Mercedes chapter to an end. However, there were some high points, with two wins, including another home victory, and a special weekend in Brazil, where Hamilton has honorary citizenship and got the opportunity to drive Senna’s 1990 McLaren. Hamilton has an affinity with the people of the South American country, and his helmet covered in the Brazilian flag was a fan favourite.\n2024 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix\nAn emotional final outing for Mercedes only resulted in P4, but the Brackley outfit honoured their driver with a lid signed by the whole team, while the design featured a red star for Lauda and the German for ‘thank you’, ‘Danke’, on the back.\nFerrari – Special Scuderia Lids\n2025\nAfter so long with Mercedes, it was unusual watching Hamilton in Ferrari red, but the Briton’s excitement to join the Italian team was clear to see. Once again, Hamilton went back to where it all started, donning the yellow from his childhood .\n2025 Miami Grand Prix\nThe Sprint podium in Miami was a highlight in Hamilton’s tricky maiden season for the Scuderia, which he claimed while wearing a blue and white race suit, and special blue helmet.\n2025 Italian Grand Prix\nHamilton had to wear something special for his first race in front of the Tifosi at Monza for Ferrari, and a white and yellow helmet featuring a tribute to Lauda, who won two titles with the Italian team, was a good way to do it.\n2025 Singapore Grand Prix\nThe golden lid for Singapore looked stunning under the lights of the Marina Bay Street Circuit.\n2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix\nHamilton brought something dazzling for the ‘City of Lights,’ wearing a helmet covered in silver glitter to stand out as he sped through the Vegas streets.\n2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix\nA long season for the seven-time World Champion came to an end in Abu Dhabi, but he had one last special helmet to show off. A metallic masterpiece with seven stars and sparkling yellow streaks brought the year to a close."}

I’m obviously very happy now the news is out. I’m very much looking forward to it next year.”\nLindblad was also reminded about a now-viral video from his go-karting days when he approached McLaren F1 driver Lando Norris and declared that he would join him on the grid in five years’ time – a promise he has kept.\n“It’s come quite quickly; I’ve gone through the ranks very fast,” Lindblad continued.\n“It’s a funny story with Lando, I just remember seeing him and it’s the first thing that came to mind. When I started this journey when I was five, I believed I could be in F1. I had that same belief when I was 14 and I have that same belief today.\n“I’m very happy that I stuck to the timeline and it’s a nice little story now.”\nWith his rise to F1 almost complete, Lindblad took a moment to reflect on what he has learned along the way – especially in the F3 and F2 championships.\n“I’ve learnt an immense amount,” he said. “When I stepped into F3 I had just done one year of F4, so I was very new to everything. I’ve had to make a massive step on all sides, on everything, over the last two years.\n“To choose one [thing] is not easy. I think probably the biggest thing is just how little track time we have and having to learn to deal with that.\n“I had to make a big step in F3, I’ve had to make another big step this year. Just because of how fast I’ve come through, every weekend I’ve had to be focusing on improving myself.”\nHolding sixth in the 2025 F2 standings ahead of this weekend’s finale in Abu Dhabi, where he will also make another FP1 outing with Red Bull, Lindblad is now determined to sign off his junior career in style.\n“I’m really focused on just trying to finish the year strong,” added Lindblad, who has scored two wins and four podiums this season.\n“It’s not been the best year. I’m happy that we sort of rescued the weekend in Qatar [with fourth in the Feature Race], but it’s not been the easiest.\n“That’s my main focus at the moment, to try and finish the year strong, have a good result here and then focus about next year from next week. All that matters to me now is F2.”"}

The two raced alongside each other at Red Bull from 2016 to 2018, but Verstappen explained that the change to number 3 has been a dream of his throughout his career.\nIn an interview with Viaplay, he said: “It won't be number 33. My favourite number has always been 3, apart from number 1. We can now swap, so it’ll be number 3.\n“Number 33 was always fine, but I just like one 3 better than two. I always said it represented double luck, but I've already had my luck in Formula 1.”\nIt was also confirmed that both the FIA and Ricciardo, who retired from the sport in 2024 after an underwhelming final season with RB, gave permission for Verstappen to reinstate the number on the 2026 grid."}

It’s an amazing comeback, an amazing win.\n“A dominant win today in a clean race. It’s not a track where we were expecting to dominate, but that’s what the guys with Max have been able to do, to come up with a super-fast car here. Very, very proud of the amazing job everyone in Milton Keynes has done to give us not only that race but a sensational comeback in the second part of the year.\n“Well done to Lando, it was a tough but a great fight. I hope it was great as well for the fans to have this championship still open up until the end of the year, the very last lap of the last race. And that’s it, we’ll try harder next.”\nPushed on whether he felt that more could have been done in the Grand Prix to secure the championship for Verstappen, Mekies responded: “No, really I don’t think so.\n“It was the most perfect race in terms of how the team and Max have managed it from the start – from the pole of yesterday, starting from a difficult Friday to a dominant pole yesterday, leading pretty much from the beginning to the end, super good tyre management.\n“I don’t think there is anything better than that. We cannot control what’s happening behind. We just look at ourselves, and I don’t think we could have done anything better today.”\nOn the other side of the garage, Yuki Tsunoda – in his last race for Red Bull before becoming a reserve driver for the team in 2026 – received a five-second time penalty for making more than one change of direction whilst defending against Norris during a scrap with the McLaren .\n“It was a surprise,” Mekies said of the penalty. “But it’s always the hardest job in the world for the stewards to come up with something in some situations. It was a surprise, but ultimately it did not affect the result of the championship, so we just keep the win and well done to Lando for the title.”\nWith the race at the Yas Marina Circuit bringing the curtain down on an eventful 24-race campaign, Mekies expressed his pride at what Red Bull have been able to achieve during the season.\n“It’s always full of emotion,” the Frenchman conceded. “I think the first dominant feeling is that we got a sensational turnaround, something that you don’t see every year, probably you don’t see every decade, and that’s what the girls and the guys have done.\n“So that’s the main feeling – very, very proud, very impressed by this team that never ever gave up on this season, and it was pure racing spirit up until the last lap. We are missing two points, but it doesn’t change how extraordinary this turnaround has been.”"}

I think it has taken a part of our heart when we have seen him spending his free weekends, being a new dad , racing with GT3 cars around the world.\n“I don’t know. It’s up to you guys to say if in that case that would become the best of his titles, but for sure, in terms of whatever happens next, the scale of the comeback is something that hopefully will go in a few history books.”\nMekies went on to explain how Verstappen’s measured approach, mixed with Red Bull’s way of operating, has ensured that their comeback feels like a “privilege” rather than “pressure”.\n“He is incredibly relaxed,” said Mekies. “There is no acting there. Honestly, he has been like that for the little that I’ve seen of him in the second part of the year. He has been like that in the bad moments and in the positive moments.\n“He’s very much embracing the approach we have. We take it race by race. We never quite looked at the championship points. We always felt that we go to a race, try to get the car in the right window, which is difficult enough… In the second part of the year, if we were doing that, it would mean that he would have a chance to fight for the win.\n“On Sunday night, you look in each other’s eyes and you know if you’re doing a good job or not. The points are just the consequence.\n“That approach has given both Max and the team the confidence of focusing on the right things and not to feel a pressure, but instead to feel a privilege to be in a historical fight and a historical comeback.”"}

Max did a pole [lap] twice today, on both his runs in Q3. It was an unbelievable performance.\n“Very, very proud of the team – we were not the fastest car out there yesterday, and we finished yesterday nearly four tenths off McLaren on the short runs.\n“Of course it’s difficult to read the Fridays, but the car really has improved compared to where we were yesterday, certainly in Qualifying conditions, so big credit to everyone back at the factory and at the track to have nailed the right window for our car today and extracted everything and more.\n“Both drivers did a fantastic job, both cars in Q3, Yuki helping with a tow on the first run and Max posting two unbelievable laps, so very happy. No points for Saturday, but we can now concentrate on trying to extract everything we can for the race pace.”\nIn terms of how the Milton Keynes-based outfit are approaching Sunday’s decisive race, Mekies outlined that the team will “concentrate on ourselves”.\n“The focus now will go simply in trying to see what can we do to extract the last half a tenth of race pace tomorrow, based on what we have learned today,” the Frenchman explained. “As you know there is a limited amount of things we can do on the car, but that’s all we will be focusing on.\n“And the rest, we don’t control what’s behind us, so what matters is that we go tomorrow in the race with the fastest race car possible.

We have a tough car to drive. And of course, we have tried everything we could to support Yuki.\n“At some stage, we had to make the difficult call between where we were seeing that going for the following years. I hope, and I think, that Yuki will get another chance. He will be reserve driver with us next year.”\nMekies went on to explain why he believes that Tsunoda has the qualities required to find his way back to a full-time F1 seat in the future.\n“You never know what's going to happen,” the team boss continued. “We have been quite famous in making fairly swift driver decisions in the past.\n“I recall one moment – at the end of the 2024 season, Yuki was driving very well. It was very difficult for him to digest. Liam was getting the promotion in Red Bull Racing.\n“He went into the winter thinking, was he going to get the chance one day or not? He came back, and we set ourselves with the team at the time the objective to maximise everything – to shoot for the stars. Three races after, he was driving in that Oracle Red Bull Racing team.\n“So you never know what the future holds. I'm sure everyone in this room and beyond has experienced setbacks – sometimes hard setbacks. That’s a setback for him. But I am confident that he has a lot in him that will allow him to have another opportunity.”"}

Of the top 10 finishers, only Fernando Alonso pitted twice. Just one driver ran the soft with the sole aim of setting the fastest race lap.\n“Graining and degradation were both limited and so, even those who pitted before half-distance managed to run just two stints with no difficulties.”\nCurrent form\nAfter 23 action-packed rounds, it all comes down to this.\nThree drivers with seven race wins apiece in 2025, covered by just 16 points.

Fine, great if I win another one, but to be realistic, we are still in this fight because of other people’s failures, not because of – if you look at the whole of the season – what we did.\n“Yes, we did really well. We have really maximised pretty much all of the races. If we had been in the position of how dominant a car they [McLaren] had, the championship would have been over a long time ago.”\nAs a team, McLaren blew their rivals away this year, securing the Teams’ Championship at the Singapore Grand Prix with six rounds still to go. And despite Mercedes and Red Bull’s recent stronger performances, the Woking outfit’s early dominance means they still have over 330 points more than both of their nearest competitors.\nHowever, the battle for the drivers’ title has unfolded differently, with the lead changing hands after Oscar Piastri’s form fell away in the second part of the season. What was a deficit of over 100 points for Verstappen after Zandvoort rapidly decreased, leaving him mathematically still in contention.\nHowever, Norris was nevertheless quick to dispute Verstappen’s claim that in another world where he had the same performance as McLaren, he would have already won his fifth title.\nSpeaking after the Sprint , in which Norris kept the Dutchman behind him to take P3, he said: “Max is very welcome to say everything he wants, to be honest. He’s kind of earned the right. You know, he’s won four World Championships. I have a lot of respect and I think that gives anyone a lot of credit.\n“He’s achieved an incredible amount – more than anyone generally dreams of achieving. So, you know, Max generally has a good clue about a lot of things, but there’s also a lot of things he doesn’t have much of a clue about.\n“It’s also Red Bull’s way of going about things, this kind of aggressive nature and, yeah, just talking nonsense a lot of the time. So it depends if you want to listen to it and talk about it – like you love to – or you do what we do as a team, which is just kind of keep our heads down, keep focused. So maybe he would have done, but he hasn’t so far, and he keeps trying.”\nNorris could win his first World Championship in Sunday’s Qatar Grand Prix – and there are a myriad of ways he could do it , but the most straightforward is taking the chequered flag first.\nThat task has been made more difficult after Piastri took pole position for Sunday's race as Norris aborted his final attempt and settled for second place, with Verstappen set to start third. Overtaking is not the easiest around the Lusail International Circuit, so the opening lap represents the Briton’s best chance of taking the lead.\nAsked what happened on his second lap in Q3, he said: “I don’t know. I just got a bit of understeer and I was going to go off so I had to abort which is a shame, but it’s the way it is. Oscar did a good lap and drove well and has been driving well all weekend. Nothing to complain about, just didn’t do the lap. I’m still P2 for tomorrow.\n“The first couple of laps are always opportunities for everyone, but after that I think it’s probably going to be pretty straightforward for everyone.\n“Tonight we’ll review some things and see what I can do better than I did this morning. Otherwise, I think we’re in a good position. The car’s been feeling good and I was much happier today than yesterday, so that’s progress but it’s a long race tomorrow.”"}

The second half of the season I've really been able to show to myself what I could do, what I was capable of doing.”\nHis turnaround at the Monaco Grand Prix saw him take a spectacular last-gasp pole position, putting him on track to finish the year with seven poles, seven race wins and 423 points to become McLaren’s first drivers’ champion since Lewis Hamilton back in 2008.\nHe couldn’t afford to let up at any stage, especially after he reclaimed a narrow championship lead at the Mexico City Grand Prix in commanding fashion, giving him the most to lose in the final rounds.\nNorris handled the pressure of having two extremely close rivals who he admitted were “pretty freaking fast and certainly made my life tough”, and he did exactly what was necessary in Abu Dhabi to secure the minimum result for him to take the title.\n“Oscar the whole way since Round 1, I knew he was probably going to be the toughest guy to beat and then you can never count out Max – he's Max,” he explained. “We certainly never counted him out – for anyone who might have done, he proved you wrong.\n“I'm glad we kept ourselves on our toes and we were ready for such a thing. It was a pleasure to fight Max, four-time World Champion, so for me to have those fights against him and enjoy those moments, maybe not always enjoy them but some of them.\n“But just to share the track and fight against another World Champion like him and certainly Oscar as well, who will be a World Champion.

It's all my mechanics, my engineers, everyone that's part of McLaren gets to have that acknowledgement too.\n\"So, it's not for me, it's for them as well. It's their pride, knowing that they put a lot of work and effort into everything that they can also go 'we're number one'.\n\"It's not as cool when you say 'we are number four' so they will be even happier than I am!\"\nSince 2014, F1 drivers have been allowed to pick a number that would stick with them for their careers. In that time Lewis Hamilton was the only World Champion to decline to run the number 1 – with the choice being given to the driver. Instead, he always stuck with his own race number 44.\nVerstappen previously raced under ‘33’ before becoming World Champion, but it remains to be seen if he will return to that number or apply to change for 2026.\nAs for Norris, he will roll out for pre-season testing next year with a new car, a new number and a new-found confidence as the reigning Formula 1 World Champion."}

Norris proved to be his closest challenger, but at 0.201s adrift could not beat the Dutchman, meaning that the championship leader will line up in second on the grid.\nReflecting on the session straight after jumping out of the car, Norris explained: “It’s tough. It’s tough. Max did a good job, so congrats to him. We did everything we could. I think my lap was pretty good, I was pretty happy.\n“Of course I’m disappointed not to be on pole for the final weekend, but we just weren’t fast enough today, so we’ll have to try and do it tomorrow.”\nSharing further thoughts later on, the 26-year-old suggested that the outcome of Qualifying “could have been a lot worse”, adding: “I expected it to be a lot closer into Q3, and the Quali battle then was between me and Oscar.\n“Max was too far ahead – they were too fast. We didn’t quite have the speed in the car today. A tough one to take, but otherwise I think we got everything out of it. I think Oscar said he did a pretty good lap and I thought I did a pretty good lap. Just not fast enough come Qualifying, but tomorrow’s a new day.”\nWhen asked how he is feeling about Sunday’s race – one in which he could potentially win his first title – Norris said: “Remarkably normal. I guess I feel the same, a little bit disappointed we couldn’t get first, even though it was just out of reach today.\n“It’s just always nice to end the season on top like we did last year. We didn’t win the [Drivers’] Championship last year, but it was just nice to end with a win. That’s what I would like to do tomorrow, in either our cases. I feel good, and we’ll go in and do everything the same as normal.”\nA podium would be enough for Norris to be confirmed as World Champion , regardless of where Verstappen and Piastri finish. However, when quizzed on whether he would simply aim for the rostrum or target victory instead, the British driver remained unsure.\n“I don’t know. The time will come that I think of that,” he explained. “For now, I’m disappointed to not be on pole, and I still want to try and win tomorrow, so that’s going to be the goal.”"}

Also the less obvious things that we could improve on. That’s normal post-race understandings, and therefore preparations for the next race.\n“Otherwise, nothing does change, it gets treated the same from everyone inside the team. It’s more excitement, I guess, for everyone at the same time. Apart from that, the work and how you approach it all remains the same.”\nWhile Verstappen declared that “everything is a bonus” on his side after a remarkable post-summer recovery and Piastri played into his own outsider status, Norris was later asked if he feels there is more to lose as the championship leader.\n“I guess in terms of position of course I have the most to lose, because I’m the one at the top,” he commented. “I’ll do my best to stay there until the end of the year – a few more days!\n“At the same time, if it doesn’t go my way, I’ll try again next year. It’ll hurt probably for a little while, then that’s life, we’ll crack on and try and do better next season.\n“I also feel the mentality of having nothing to lose, because it’s just a race, for a championship, but in 30 years’ time I probably won’t think of it that much either way.”\nThat said, Norris’ answer to a follow-up question highlighted just what it would mean to the 26-year-old Briton to put his hands on the sport’s ultimate prize.\n“Ask me hopefully in a few days, or a few weeks,” Norris smiled.\n“This has been my whole life, it’s everything I’ve worked towards my whole life, so it would mean the world to me, and it would mean the world to everyone that’s supported me and pushed me for the last 16 years of my life, in terms of trying to get to this point.\n“It would mean everything. It would mean my life until now has been a success and I’ve accomplished that dream I had when I was a kid. Other than that, I don’t know what else to probably say.\n“It’s a reward for a lot of hard work that goes into things, and I think it goes to whoever deserves it most.”"}

It’s been a long time and a difficult season, and in the middle when we dipped below.\n“But it’s a long journey, it’s a difficult journey. There’s a lot of pain involved in getting there – painful days and long days and sacrifices, and now we’re there. Champion of the world, it’s cool.”\nWhile finishing in the top three was enough to guarantee Norris the title, that result did not always look certain at stages of the Grand Prix, with Norris having to overtake cars following his pit stop which included a close battle with Red Bull ’s Yuki Tsunoda .\nWhen quizzed on how his heart rate was as he watched on through all of that, Adam Norris smiled: “It was actually really good. For the first time all year, I locked myself in a room, I watched it without commentary, and I just sat there with the headphones on and very quietly watched the whole thing.\n“The commentary gets you excited, so when I’m at home I get really excited! My heart rate’s going through the roof, so my thing was, ‘Can I listen to some classical music?’. And you know, if he’d had a puncture he wouldn’t have got there.”\nThe elder Norris paid tribute to the “good team” around his son, before conceding that the achievement might take some time to sink in.\n“I think it will do,” he admitted. “But I love the journey, and I really loved those places you go to that no tourist would go to. You go to remote little tracks, and I love the journey – I really enjoyed every part of that journey, but it was hard, really difficult.\n“Some of the other parents packed up because they didn’t want to do that, but I was there and the team was there the whole way through to keep going.”\nAnd when asked what he said to Lando as they embraced following his triumph, Norris senior said: “I can’t swear, but just 'champion of the world'. You can never take it away – if someone’s won that, you can never take it away. It’s a big day.”\nIt was also a momentous occasion for Norris’ mum, Cisca Wauman, who summed up her feelings to Sky Sports F1 as: “Emotionally drained, but very happy. Very happy for the family, for the team, McLaren, the fans, because they’ve been always there.”\nWauman echoed Adam Norris’ comments about the journey up until this moment, explaining that there have been “a lot of sacrifices” along the way.\n“When Lando was seven, he started karting; by the time he was eight he was competing together with his brother Ollie, and it took the two boys one direction and the two girls I have the other direction,” she reflected.\n“So I missed Lando and Ollie, seeing them growing up as kids. Suddenly playing with a tractor naked in the garden was done, and I missed that! But this is amazing, this is fantastic.”\nAs the race moved closer to its finish, Wauman spoke of the tension that she felt, adding: “Those last laps, they took ages! You never know [what can happen], until the race is done.\n“They were calling us down because me and Adam were sitting in a room separately, and they were calling us down with 10 laps to go – the race is not over, how can they call us down getting ready for this!

That relationship, and their trust in each other, was crucial in Norris claiming F1's ultimate prize.\nWith Max Verstappen winning the season finale, Norris took the third place that he needed to guarantee the title, eventually triumphing by two points over the Red Bull man.\nHad he dropped behind Charles Leclerc, the Championship would have belonged to his rival and, given how quick the Ferrari driver was at times, it added a stressful element to proceedings – something Joseph acknowledged.\n“I think Lando seemed more comfortable than we were!” Joseph explained to F1 TV . \"We sort of knew how much pace Lando thought he had in hand. At one point we just said okay enough is enough [with Leclerc], just use the pace to get away because this is stressing us out too much.\n“I think Lando did a great job, he must have felt comfortable until we gave him the hurry up… You know, I didn’t get a lot of sleep last night. We were going over all the possibilities, the what ifs, the buts, what if [Verstappen] does this, what if he does that.\n“I think we came really well prepared, there were a lot of strong discussions last night and this morning, and it has proved us well. McLaren are very good at preparing. Some people judge us for it, some people say we talk too much on the radio.\n\"But we prepare well, we go well, we discuss things and it’s gone well, we won the Constructors’ back in Singapore and today we made history again with Lando and I’m very proud to be a part of it.”\nJoseph also went on to explain that Norris – who is now the 35th F1 World Champion and the 11th to hail from Britain – has made the team “stronger and stronger” by pushing them, after years of McLaren focusing on the driver’s own development.\n“Each year you get better and better and we are at the point now where Lando is leading us, and he is more demanding of us and the table has turned,\" Joseph added. \"At the beginning we pushed him and now he pushes us, we go away and we work harder.\"\nAs for one of the flashpoints of a gripping season finale, Norris admitted after the race that Joseph did not tell him he was under investigation for going off track and gaining an advantage when fighting Yuki Tsunoda – a sensible move not to distract Norris at a crucial part of the race, especially since the stewards opted to take no further action.\n“I’m good at maths, I did a degree in engineering, said Joseph, when asked about that moment. \"I can set-up a race car, I can work with engineers, that’s bread and butter for me, that’s easy.\n“Psychology is not what an engineer is typically good at, so maintaining that psychology with a driver is the toughest bit of a race engineer’s job.\n“So that’s what I found toughest.

Carlos Sainz took 13th for Williams, with Tsunoda a penalised 14th after earning a five-second time penalty for his mid-race defence against Norris on an offset tyre strategy.\nNext up was Kimi Antonelli in his Mercedes, from Williams’ Alex Albon, who took a penalty for speeding in the pit lane, and the Racing Bulls cars of Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson – the former losing out with an early stop and the latter penalised for a clash with Bearman.\nAlpine brought up their usual 2025 positions at the rear of the field, with Pierre Gasly ending the day a couple of seconds up on Franco Colapinto, despite also being penalised for exceeding track limits.\nAS IT HAPPENED\nAfter 23 action-packed rounds and a host of twists and turns, it all came down to this: three drivers in contention for the 2025 Drivers’ Championship, with 58 more laps deciding whether it would go to Norris, Verstappen or Piastri.\nWhile Norris headed into the weekend with the points advantage, sitting 12 clear of Verstappen and a further four ahead of Piastri, it was the Red Bull man who seized the initiative in Qualifying to claim pole position over the McLaren pair.\nIt set up a tantalising prospect for race day, with the nerves, excitement and anticipation building throughout the afternoon before the sun set over the Yas Marina Circuit, the floodlights switched on, and the all-important start approached.\nWhen the cars lined up on the grid, with a one-stop strategy expected, it was revealed that the majority of drivers would be starting on the medium tyres, with Piastri, Tsunoda, Antonelli and Stroll going for hards, and Hamilton, Albon and Hulkenberg taking softs.\nA few anxious moments later, it was time for lights out – Verstappen making a strong enough getaway to keep his pole advantage from Norris and Piastri, with Leclerc and Alonso squabbling in fourth and fifth, and Russell dropping to sixth.\nHalfway around the lap, Piastri pulled off one of the moves of the season – and no doubt raised heart rates on the McLaren pit wall – with an audacious move on team mate Norris around the outside of Turn 9, despite him running that harder rubber.\nNorris still held the position and points he needed to secure the crown, but with Leclerc and Alonso hovering in his mirrors. On Lap 4, Leclerc piled the pressure on with his own DRS-assisted look into Turn 9, but he could not quite make it stick.\nRussell reported a long brake pedal after his tricky start, which included a heap of wheelspin, but that did not stop him from reclaiming fifth by passing Alonso into the Turn 6/7 chicane. Behind them, Bortoleto held seventh over Hadjar and Ocon, with Tsunoda rounding out the top 10.\nElsewhere, Colapinto was noted for a start procedure infringement, as well as Hamilton and Albon and Antonelli and Stroll for midfield battles – the latter two regarding drivers leaving the track and gaining an advantage.\n“This is good for now Max. We may wish to go longer, so just keep on top,” was the message to race leader Verstappen at this point. Shortly afterwards, Hulkenberg became the first driver to pit, swapping his softs for a set of hards.\nWith the race reaching double lap figures, Piastri received a hurry-up from his engineer to go and chase Verstappen, and in turn give Norris a little more clean air to work with. Norris was informed of that message and continued to hover precariously around the one-second DRS window back to Leclerc.\nAnother incident involving Gasly and Hulkenberg was noted and dismissed at this point, while Lawson and Bearman came under the stewards’ microscope for alleged erratic driving – the New Zealander subsequently being given a five-second penalty.\nRussell, Hadjar and Bearman were the next drivers to pit, swapping their medium tyres for hards. Would Ferrari and McLaren respond by pitting Leclerc and Norris? McLaren’s mechanics initially came out into the pit lane, but then returned to the garage.\n“Keep building this gap on Leclerc, it gives us choices,” was the next message to Norris. Then, at the end of Lap 16, the Briton headed for the pits along with Leclerc and Alonso. Crucially, Norris rejoined ahead of Russell, but with a lot of midfield runners to clear.\nVerstappen and Piastri (understandably given his more durable tyres) stayed out for the time being, with just under two seconds between the pair. “Oscar, do you think we could do Plan A?” Piastri’s engineer enquired. “I think it’s doable for now,” came the reply.\nWhile the top two pressed ahead, Norris had his hands full behind yet-to-pit cars, forcing decisive moves on Antonelli, Stroll and Lawson to regain clear air. A little bit further back, Leclerc was noted for moving under braking in a battle with Russell, before both looked to replicate Norris’ charge through the traffic.\nNext up for Norris? Outgoing Red Bull man Tsunoda. “We expect Norris to be in your DRS within one lap. All you can when he catches,” the Japanese racer was told over the radio. “I know what to do, so leave to me,” he hit back.\nOn Lap 23, Norris got within that DRS window – Tsunoda almost forcing the championship contender onto the grass as they charged towards the Turn 6/7 chicane, but Norris keeping his cool under braking to make the move stick and edge one step closer to the crown.\nHowever, a couple of messages soon followed from the stewards and added some more jeopardy to the situation. One being for Tsunoda allegedly forcing Norris off the track, and one being for Norris allegedly leaving the track and gaining an advantage.\nA lap later, leader Verstappen decided it was the right time to pit and swap his medium tyres for hards, releasing Piastri into the lead. Norris, meanwhile, got his head down to pump in a series of fastest laps and create a two-second buffer over Leclerc.\nThe wait for the stewards’ decisions was a short one, with Tsunoda being given a five-second penalty due to his weaving, and no further action being taken on Norris’ overtake, serving as a huge boost for the latter’s title aspirations.\n“Penalty?! What penalty, bro?!” Tsunoda shouted over the radio when informed of his penalty. At the same time, the stewards confirmed that there would be no further action over Leclerc and Russell’s earlier scrap at Turn 9.\nAfter 33 laps, the yet-to-stop Piastri led Verstappen by some 11 seconds, with Norris five seconds further back in third, from Leclerc, Russell, Stroll (also yet to pit), Alonso, Bortoleto, Ocon and Hulkenberg, who had Bearman all over his tail in the fight for the final point.\nWilliams were having a quiet race, with Sainz and Albon running 12th and 13th, ahead of early-stopper Hadjar, the Alpines of Gasly and Colapinto, Hamilton (who had moved to a two-stop strategy), the penalised Tsunoda, Lawson and Antonelli.\n“The rear’s starting to get a bit worse now,” reported leader Piastri over the radio as the laps ticked by – the gap back to Verstappen coming down to six seconds, with Norris and Leclerc also closing in rapidly.\nOn Lap 40, with Piastri still circulating up front, Leclerc headed to the pit lane for a second time to take on fresh medium tyres, prompting Norris to cover that off next time around (fitting hards). At the back, Albon was given a five-second penalty for speeding on his own visit to the pits.\nNot long after that, Verstappen got himself into Piastri’s DRS window and breezed past the McLaren down the back straight. A few corners later, Piastri made his long-awaited pit stop and moved over to the medium tyres for the final few laps.\nPiastri was told to hunt down Verstappen – now 24 seconds clear – on his fresh rubber, but while he would cut that number in half over the remaining laps, the top two positions were essentially locked in, and all the attention turned back to Norris.\nAfter that early pressure from Leclerc, Norris had managed to build a more comfortable margin, with more than five seconds now separating the two drivers, meaning all the champion-elect had to do was keep things under control until the finish.\nKeep it under control is exactly what he did and, just over 15 seconds after Verstappen took a deserved final win of the season, Norris secured the third position he required to earn the title and write his name into the F1 history books.\nLeclerc took the best of the rest accolade in fourth, from Russell and Alonso, as Ocon pipped Hamilton to seventh after a fierce late-race battle, Hulkenberg came home ninth and the late-stopping Stroll bagged the final point – even with a penalty for erratic driving against Sainz.\nBortoleto just missed out on a point in 11th, with Bearman dropping from ninth to 12th after a penalty for making more than one change of direction in a late fight with Stroll, Sainz winding up 13th and Tsunoda – after his own penalty – having to settle for 14th.\nAlbon joined Norris, Leclerc, Hamilton and Hulkenberg in making two stops, but could only place 16th, behind Antonelli, with the Racing Bulls featuring down in 17th and 18th after difficult races for 2026 Red Bull driver Hadjar and Lawson.\nA five-second penalty for exceeding track limits on multiple occasions did little to impact Gasly’s evening, as the Frenchman placed a lapped 19th over team mate Colapinto at the end of a season Alpine will be keen to move on from.\nAs the drivers returned to the pits for one last time in 2025, one man stood above the rest – Norris completing a series of donuts on the main straight before climbing atop his McLaren, taking in the cheers from the crowd and starting to process what he had just achieved.\nKey quote\n“Oh God! I’ve not cried in a while,” said Norris. “I didn’t think I’d cry but I did. It’s a long journey. First of all, I want to say a big thanks to my guys, everyone at McLaren, my parents... I’m not crying! My mum, my dad, they were the ones who supported me since the beginning.\n“It feels amazing. Now I know what Max feels like a little bit, and I want to congratulate Max and Oscar, my two biggest competitors all season. It’s been a pleasure to race against both of them, and I’ve learnt a lot from both of them as well. I’ve enjoyed it, it’s been a long year, but we did it, and I’m so proud of everyone.”\nWhat’s next\nF1 drivers and teams will now take a break over the winter before returning to action ahead of the 2026 season in a private test at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya from January 26-30 ."}

Nevertheless, he maintained his rediscovered form to qualify third for the finale, behind his fellow title contenders on the front row.\nWith a 16-point deficit to overcome in order to win the championship, he recognised that a lot had to fall into place for him to have a chance. A strong start saw him pass Norris for P2 on the opening lap, but he couldn’t do much to get the better of Verstappen , especially on a 41-lap stint on hard tyres.\nAsked how he was feeling about finishing second in the race, he replied: “Honestly, pretty good. I knew that going into today I needed the stars to align to win the championship.\n“Ultimately, I tried my best and put myself in the best position I could to try and win the race and give myself the best opportunity, but it wasn’t to be. I think we can be very proud of the season we’ve had.\n“On a personal level, it’s obviously not quite the ending that I wished for but I think when you look at the season as a whole, I’m very proud of the work that I’ve been able to put in and my team have been able to put in to make so much progress from last year. I’m looking forward to plenty more fights in the future.”\nMcLaren elected to split the strategies between their drivers, starting the eventual champion on medium tyres while Piastri was given a set of the hard compound to begin the race. The choice allowed him to extend his first stint, but meant that by the time he finally pitted, he faced Verstappen’s unassailable lead of 24 seconds.\nDue to the three contenders all finishing on the podium, Piastri lost out on his maiden title by 13 points, with Norris ending the season on 423 to beat their Red Bull rival by just two points.\n“It is nice to end the last couple of weekends on a relative high, certainly from a performance point of view,” he summarised. “I guess individually it was nice to find some form again because it would have been pretty painful to end it on the note that Austin, Mexico and Brazil kind of went to.\n“Ultimately, there were ups and downs through the year. I’ll look back on the ups with a lot of pride and joy, and look on the downs with plenty of lessons learned. There are plenty more years left to go and hopefully plenty more opportunities.”"}

Hopefully there’s some more stuff we can get out of it overnight.\n“It’s not been a bad day, for sure, it’s been a positive day, but we always know it gets a lot closer going into quali, so nothing to smile about just yet.”\nThere was a moment of drama between title rivals Norris and Verstappen early in FP2 (see in the video above), with the Red Bull darting out of the way of the McLaren exiting Turn 1, but while the stewards noted and looked into the incident, they ultimately opted against any further action.\nBehind the front-running Norris and Verstappen, Piastri started the weekend back in 11th position, having only appeared in FP2 due to McLaren reserve Pato O’Ward’s outing in FP1 – as per F1’s mandatory running for rookie drivers."}

In the second episode, he heads to Milan to meet Alpine's Pierre Gasly.\nWhen a Formula 1 driver arrives at a racetrack, he selects full race mode and puts everything else out of his mind to focus on the day job. Over the course of the last decade covering the sport, that's usually the mode they're engaged in when I get to talk to them through my role as an interviewer for F1. But for a change of pace and as part of an exclusive new series, I headed Off The Grid to hang out with the sport's elite racers away from the office.\nIn episode two, French racer and Grand Prix winner Pierre Gasly invited me to Milan, the place he now calls home. The 29-year-old, who like his rival Oscar Piastri in episode one gave up one of his rare days off to take part in filming (rather than via mandatory team media or commercial time), talks about the pain of losing one of his closest friends, his demotion from Red Bull and resurgence at AlphaTauri, his relationship with fellow French racer Esteban Ocon and the next chapter with Alpine .\nPierre Gasly's grandmother was a regional kart champion, his grandfather competed, too. So it's perhaps no surprise that Gasly found himself sat behind the wheel of a kart, which he borrowed from Ocon, when he was six and instantly fell in love with it.\n\"The speed, the fear, the adrenaline I felt on that day was so strong, I can still remember it even if it was 23 years ago,\" he says when we chat on his very comfortable sofa in his Milan apartment. \"I fell in love with the sport straightaway.\"\nThe Frenchman battled his way through the junior ranks, catching the eye of Red Bull , who brought him into the family as part of their junior programme. He went on to win GP2 – the feeder series to Formula 1 at the time – in his second full-time campaign, and hoped that that would be enough to earn promotion to a Formula 1 seat. Unfortunately, he missed out.\n\"It was so hard to take as I was told, 'If you win the GP2 championship you are going to get a shot in Formula 1',\" he says. \"It was like a slam in my face. I thought, 'Okay, what do I need to do more?' I kept the mentality that I would get my shot.\"\nGasly kept his head down, focused on the testing opportunities he got with Red Bull and Toro Rosso – and then the phone rang. It was Dr Helmut Marko , Red Bull's recently-departed motorsport advisor .\n\"I remember I was jumping on my bed in Malaysia,\" he says. \"I went as a reserve for Red Bull. He called me to say get ready – this weekend, you are racing. When I got the shot, I was the happiest. I remember going on the grid and knowing I'm given this chance, now it's in my hands, I have the car, the team, the people – now it's up to me and I'm in control.\n\"I did four or five races in 2017, and then I started the season in 2018. In the second race, bang – P4 in Bahrain. It created straight away massive hype. Right after Budapest, Daniel [Ricciardo] announced he was leaving [Red Bull]. I remember arriving in Greece for my holiday, and it was like, 'Whoa, Daniel is going'.\n\"Red Bull had Carlos Sainz as an option and they had me. It's between Sainz and myself. The phone rang and Helmut told me 'Okay, you're a Red Bull Racing driver at start of next year – this was six months into my first [full] season in F1.\"\nWe take a break from filming to have a tour around his very tidy apartment. The carpets were all ripped up shortly after he and his girlfriend got their dog Simba. The smooth floors provide endless entertainment for Simba as he excitedly zooms around the apartment on the slippery surface as Gasly shows us around. His balcony offers stunning views across Milan – and is where he often hangs out with friends when he gets some downtime between races.\nHe's got a games room, complete with simulator and framed shirts of his favourite footballers, including Lionel Messi, who he met while on holiday. Gasly is big into football, so much so, he became a co-owner of French third division club FC Versailles.\nWe switch back to chat mode – and get into his unfortunately short stint at Red Bull. \"I'm not going to lie, it was sad,\" he says. \"2019, my second year in Formula 1 – there was no support from anywhere, in a very big team which is very much supporting Max [Verstappen] – for good reasons, because he's put on the results.\n\"But I'm starting with a fresh engineer coming from Formula E who didn't have experience in F1. So it was a strange dynamic. I wasn't really given the tools to really perform. I tried to fight my own way because I wanted, and at the end of the day I'm there to, perform. They were not happy, but I'm not happy too because I could see I couldn't show my potential.\"\nGasly was demoted back to Toro Rosso after around six months of racing. \"It almost felt like a relief,\" he says. His first race back was the Belgian Grand Prix and it turned out to be the most intense weekend of his life. Naturally, all the questioning on media day was about his demotion.\n\"It's not a nice energy,\" he says. \"I'm there to do my thing and try and give my best but it's a lot of negativity. I go through that. I just want to drive. Then came Saturday...\"\nHis friend Anthoine Hubert, with whom he raced in karting from aged nine to around 14, suffered a fatal accident on the second lap of the F2 feature race at Spa, at the same venue where Gasly was set to compete in his first race back with Toro Rosso.\nGasly and Hubert were like brothers growing up. They ate breakfast together, went to class together, trained together. Gasly would do 13 push ups, so Hubert would do 14. They pushed each other to get the very best out of each other.\n\"Initially, I didn't know who was involved,\" says Gasly, \"It looked bad. The team manager told me Anthoine was involved. As soon as the briefing was done, I ran down to get more info. I saw in the distance my parents just broken in tears. Sadly I understood straight away what had happened.\"\nHe adds: \"You get taught a lot at school and by your parents but you never get told how you're supposed to deal with yourself in this sort of situation. The one thing I regret is that in Budapest after the race [before the summer break], we went to party with Anthoine.\n\"I didn't want to leave too late. I tried to find him but I couldn't find him. I walked out, I saw him on the terrace. I waved at him and said 'have a good summer and see you at Spa'. I never got to see him again before the crash.\n\"I just wish I waited a bit longer in the club to hug him or say bye in a slightly different way. It taught me to appreciate the moment we live, with the people we love, and just to never take anything for granted.\"\nWe take a break from the chat to head out onto the streets of Milan in search of Gasly's favourite coffee place. There's naturally a vast selection of sweet treats on offer – and while the Frenchman admits he does take one every now and then, the ones he says he chooses are not much bigger than a Malteser because it won't take him long to burn off on a treadmill.\nIt's then onto his favourite store in the city for a bit of retail therapy. Gasly loves his fashion, which won't be a surprise if you've ever seen him in his civvies.\n\"I want to discover other worlds,\" he says. \"The first time I came to Milan, I was staring at how beautiful the people were. The style... everyone is so elegant. I've seen the coolest grandmas walking around town. When you go out, you need to make sure you wear some nice stuff.\"\nGasly is a stylish guy. He's also a guy who knows what he wants, so it doesn't take him long to pick out a few pieces.\nIt's then back to his story. We recall the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix , where he out-dragged Lewis Hamilton to the line to take second – and his first podium. It's a special moment in his life – and one that he is reminded of every day as a painting of that drag race is up on the wall behind his sofa.\n\"People wrote me off too quickly because they don't know me, they don't know what sort of mindset and mentality I have,\" he says. \"This is my whole life. Thinking of that podium still puts me a smile on my face.\"\nGasly is incredibly tough and oozes resilience. That's perhaps not surprising given how much heartache he's endured before he's even turned 30. It's that mental strength that has enabled him to rebuild his career – and led to him achieving his first Grand Prix victory in Monza, the home of his then-AlphaTauri team, in 2020.\n“It was incredible, which is why I took that moment on the podium, to process the millions of emotions and thoughts that crossed my mind. I was in my own world. These few seconds, I’ll keep with me forever.\n\"It was a unique moment as it was Covid, so there was no one there. The one year where Monza never looked that empty. It was a bit of a shame, but it gives me a good reason to win again in Monza!\"\nWhile Gasly hoped for a shot back at the main Red Bull team, that never looked likely – so when Alpine came calling for 2023, he grasped the opportunity. \"I put pen to paper on Anthoine's birthday,\" says Gasly. \"Anthoine was an Alpine [Academy] driver. Everything fell into place on Anthoine's birthday – I couldn't believe it.\"\nThat put Gasly alongside Ocon at Alpine. The two have history. \"We could make a full documentary about this,\" he says. \"We used to spend Wednesdays and weekends together pretty much every week, him going to my place, me going to his place. We had a strong bond.\n\"Sadly, there was a turning point in one of the races; it sort of fell apart after that in a dramatic way which is difficult to explain. We know exactly where we come from. We know what we had to go through to make it. We also both know it was actually a good thing that we had that rivalry to push us beyond our potential. I have no doubt that in 10, 20 years we'll be able to talk things out and talk things through in a different way.\"\nThat relationship seems to be improving, as was evidenced when they embraced each other on the podium in Brazil in 2024 after scoring an unlikely double podium for Alpine.\n\"In the space of eight months, we went from last to getting not one but two cars on the podium,\" he says. \"The faces on the team were priceless. It was one of those races where I'm sure post-career, I’ll pinpoint it as very special.\"\nGasly has emerged as Alpine's team leader, his most recent contract extension meaning he's set to stay at the team for six years. The hunger to succeed is unwavering – and he firmly believes he has what it takes to reach the very top.\nWhat do the next five years look like for him? \"F1 and hopefully, with Alpine, World Champion!\" he says. \"I know it's difficult for people to process. How can I say that if we're fighting for just a few points, but I believe with the people we have, I can see us fighting at the front.\"\nGiven the way Gasly has fought back from a succession of knockbacks to recover each time, it would be unwise to bet against him. Alpine just need to give him a car that can fight at the sharp end, and then it'll be up to him to deliver.\nYou can watch the full episode of Off The Grid with Pierre Gasly exclusively on F1 TV now ."}

From the best-performing drivers and strongest rookies through to the most shocking moments, we asked Lawrence Barretto, Chris Medland, David Tremayne and James Hinchcliffe for their take on all the big questions about the 2025 championship – as well as finding out who they think needs to up their game in 2026…\nWho were the top five drivers in 2025?\nLawrence Barretto (F1 Correspondent & Presenter): There's no such thing as a free World Championship, so the fact Lando Norris found a way to beat a resurgent Max Verstappen and a very classy McLaren team mate in Oscar Piastri means, for me, he's the best driver in 2025 and thoroughly deserves his maiden championship. Verstappen and Piastri complete the podium, as they did in the drivers' standings. It's hard to argue with the next two spots either, as George Russell had his best year yet for Mercedes, scooping up two wins, while Charles Leclerc in P5 managed to get seven podiums with a Ferrari that looked like a real handful all year.\nChris Medland (Special Contributor): Max Verstappen, Oscar Piastri, Lando Norris, George Russell and Carlos Sainz.\nVerstappen was an easy one for me, with only Barcelona standing out as a time he didn’t get everything out of a race weekend that he should have done. It’s a flip of a coin between the McLaren drivers, but I just go for Piastri over Norris based on the big step forward he made from year two to year three. Russell had a very strong year again, and then I spent ages picking between the Williams pair. Albon was so good for so long, and did outscore Sainz, but given it’s a new team for him and there were three top-three results in the end, the Spaniard slightly edges it.\nDavid Tremayne (Hall of Fame F1 Journalist): Max Verstappen, George Russell, Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri, Charles Leclerc.\nJames Hinchcliffe (IndyCar Race Winner and Analyst): Lando Norris is an obvious one for this list. Delivered what was needed, when it was needed to secure the title. Max Verstappen mounted a comeback that was the stuff of legend. Before the Red Bull was even in the same conversation pace-wise, Verstappen kept himself just barely in touch with the lead duo through some outstanding performances. George Russell drove a championship-calibre season in a car that wasn’t his match. The inconsistency in the Mercedes package at times hid the consistently high level that Russell was performing at.\nCarlos Sainz predicted pre-season that Williams would surprise people and that a podium was on the cards. I think he was being a bit facetious when he made those claims to F1’s digital team, but both did come true off the back of a stellar year for the Spaniard. Oscar Piastri was the title contender that few would have predicted would be in the fight in 2025. Yes, he had made big strides in 2024, but Norris still was top dog at the end of that season. Turn the page to 2025 and another gigantic leap in development made him not only a contender, but a favourite for much of the year. His struggles to adapt when his form dropped in the latter third will be what he focuses on this off-season, but if we know anything about Piastri it is that he is a very quick learner and will come back in 2026 stronger, faster and hungrier.\nWhat was the best individual performance from 2025?\nLB: That Max Verstappen was still in the title fight at the final race – and in with a genuine shot of a fifth straight crown – when he was previously 104 points adrift was remarkable and far and away the best individual performance of the season.\nCM: If it has to be one race, then Max Verstappen’s recovery from the pit lane to third place in Brazil, but I’d also just count his entire second half of the season. Verstappen had to take every opportunity available to him, and the points he scored in Brazil prevented him from losing too much ground to Norris, which was crucial in keeping the pressure on given how the next three races played out.\nDT: Max and Red Bull coming back from a 104-point deficit and finishing only two points off a fifth consecutive World Championship. By any standard that was a massive achievement from the best driver currently out there. Max is bulletproof and thinks only of how to win, and Red Bull’s engineers have an incredible will to win and ability to massage their cars – well, Max’s, at least – into winners despite their apparent shortcomings. Never say die, never give up lies at the heart of F1 racing.\nJH: This is always a tough one in a 24-race calendar with 20 of the best in the world on track, but Verstappen’s drive from pit lane to podium in Brazil was absolutely sublime. His 2024 triumph at the same track was impressive, but there is no doubt the Safety Car helped the cause. This year, not only did he not have a Safety Car to help, he had a puncture which hampered his progress early. Without that, there is every chance that he wins that race from the pits.\nWhat was your favourite story from 2025?\nLB: Nico Hulkenberg 's maiden podium at Silverstone, which came at the 239th time of asking. The German has been reborn in this second chapter of his career and has shown enough talent and pace consistently through 15 years in the sport that it would have been unfair if he never had the chance to taste the bubbles on a Formula 1 podium. He righted that wrong with a masterful drive at a soaking Silverstone.\nCM: Nico Hulkenberg’s podium at Silverstone. This and Verstappen’s performance above are basically interchangeable, but more than just the drive that Hulkenberg delivered being special, it was the overall reaction from the rest of the paddock to see him finally in the top three. It was also a first Sauber podium in 13 years, and a real feel-good moment in the year that it felt like every team member and every fan loved to see.\nDT: McLaren doing the double. They were up against a team that had to focus on only one driver, while Zak Brown and Andrea Stella generally did their utmost to play fair between their two (Monza apart, perhaps) by employing their now ‘famous’ Papaya Rules. We should be grateful for their sportsmanship insofar as they let Lando and Oscar race rather than favouring one over the other the way that Ferrari used to with Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello.\nJH: I think the Norris character arc over the season was phenomenal. Comes in as a title favourite, starts strong before losing form and being written off, only to recover the form and reward himself and everyone that’s in his bubble with the biggest reward in racing. And he did it “Lando’s way” . Throw in emotional wins at Monaco and his home race at Silverstone and you pretty much have the fairytale written.\nWhat shocked you most in 2025?\nLB: Williams . I expected this to be a transitional year for the team, given a lot of a focus was put on medium- and long-term projects to strengthen the team's foundation and prepare them to be able to fight at the front consistently in the future. And yet they were brilliant this year and deservedly P5 in the Teams' Championship. Alex Albon was awesome for the first two-thirds of the season, while Carlos Sainz proved why he is so highly-rated with a superb second-half of the campaign that yielded not one but two podiums.\nCM: The points that everyone scored. The driver finishing in 19th place in the standings had 19 points to their name, while from a team perspective, 70 points would have got you a top-six Constructors’ finish last year but was only good enough for ninth this year. Every driver to complete the season (so not counting the Alpine seat shared between Franco Colapinto and Jack Doohan) scored a top-six finish at some stage, and the field spread was ridiculously close at times.\nDT: Lewis Hamilton 's performances at Ferrari. Look at China, where he started the Sprint from pole and won , easily outpacing Oscar and Max, and it looked as if he’d made a super-smooth transition. But the manner in which his season steadily came unglued suggested that all was not well and that his copious suggestions on how to improve the recalcitrant SF-25 were falling on deaf ears.\nAnd that weird McLaren strategy call under the Safety Car in Qatar. And Christian Horner's Red Bull departure after 124 victories, 287 podiums and 14 World Championships.\nJH: The intense competitiveness of the midfield was a surprise in 2025, but the biggest shock is still the performance of Williams. Abandoned their development on 2025 as early as anyone, publicly accepting that it would be a year to suffer through to help make 2026 better, and in the hands of two incredibly fast and experienced drivers went on to take their highest Teams’ position since 2017 and have both drivers in the top 10 in points, with two podiums to their name.\nWho was your rookie of the year in 2025?\nLB: Kimi Antonelli . The Italian was thrown in at the deep end at Mercedes and, while he had a bumpy stint through the European leg of the calendar, he delivered on the expectation heaped on his shoulders from himself, the team and the whole of Italy. The way he responded to comments from boss Toto Wolff in Monza that his performance was \"underwhelming\" was outstanding, and he finished the season giving highly-rated team mate George Russell a real run for his money.\nCM: Kimi Antonelli. I think Isack Hadjar surprised people and is a very close second for me, but in terms of the level of expectation, the benchmark they were up against and the development through the year, Antonelli impressed me slightly more. The mid-season struggles were a clear low point, but he found a way to turn that around and over the final five rounds all but matched Russell, while delivering some outstanding weekends like Brazil.\nDT: I can’t really separate Kimi Antonelli and Isack Hadjar.\nThe Italian was better placed in some ways, being in a Mercedes, but it took him a while to get it all together even after his first podium in Canada. After a deep intra-team discussion and reset in Monza he was hugely impressive thereafter, sometimes outqualifying and outracing George (a feat in itself!). And keeping a charging Max, of all people, behind him in Brazil speaks volumes for his improvement, and his future. My prediction that he would win a race didn’t quite come off, but it will in 2026 if the Merc W17 lives up to expectations.\nThe sight of Isack weeping after falling off before the race even started in Melbourne was not something that we saw repeated. Instead, he gathered himself together admirably, and thereafter fully justified a critical Helmut Marko’s faith in his ability. The Racing Bulls VCARB 02 was obviously a decent car, and he used it extremely well, driving with great speed and confidence and generally steering clear of trouble, That podium at Zandvoort was excellent, and I can’t wait to see how 'Le Petit Prost' stacks up against Max chez Red Bull in 2026.\nJH: This was a very tough class in 2025, but for me the nod goes to Ollie Bearman . There are great cases for Bortoleto , Hadjar and Antonelli, too, but after some early rookie errors Bearman’s form was mighty impressive. The car’s relative performance would fluctuate week to week, but that didn’t stop him from having the longest points scoring run in the team’s history, matching the Haas team’s best-ever finishing position in a race, and outqualifying and outscoring race winning team mate Esteban Ocon over the season.\nWho needs to do better in 2026?\nLB: Ferrari . The Scuderia were in contention to win a first Teams' Championship since 2008 all the way to the final race in 2024, but failed to build on that momentum this year and endured a win-less season as they faded to P4. They must be better in 2026.\nCM: Ferrari. Easily could have been what shocked me most this year too, but I didn’t want to repeat answers! I fully expected a title challenge alongside McLaren given where both teams ended 2024, but Ferrari failed to progress. That led to a tough environment for Lewis Hamilton, but I think he’ll naturally be stronger if the car is, too. I did not have a win-less year on my radar this season – even mid-year – and I’d almost go as far as to say Ferrari can’t afford a repeat.\nDT: Everyone, of course. But specifically, Ferrari. Their performance through much of 2025 was disappointing. Having been the fastest in the final races of 2024 they gave Charles a modified car that he always had to overdrive and Lewis one with which he just didn’t click. It’s now 17 years since the Scuderia won a World Championship, a completely unacceptable drought for such a well-funded team.\nJH: Ferrari. No two ways about it. Charles Leclerc did his part to salvage the odd result, but the car and the team need to be better next season. Lewis Hamilton’s season was tough to watch, and much work needs to be done internally to get the seven-time champ to a place where he can perform at his best. The odd time the car was to his liking, we saw flashes of old Lewis, but from top to bottom big leaps are needed. 2026 offers a huge opportunity for the Scuderia, but should they fall short of expectations I would imagine a very different-looking Ferrari by 2027."}

All things considered, yesterday was just a poor showing.\n“Unfortunately we let ourselves down there, and it’s very difficult to come back from there with everyone doing similar race pace. So all things considered, very happy to steal those two points, and I think a worthy end to the last race of the season.”\nThe weekend was a historic one in bringing a close to Sauber ’s long era in the sport, 32 years after the squad – founded by Peter Sauber – made their Formula 1 debut back in 1993.\nWhen asked if the result in Sunday’s race felt like a fitting way for the name to end, Hulkenberg responded: “Yeah, absolutely.

Coming into it from the least to lose out of us three is quite different for me.\n“I think off the back of Qatar I’ve got a lot of confidence that I can perform well. Obviously I need a fair few things to happen this weekend to come out champion, but I’ll just make sure I’m in the right place at the right time and see what happens.”\nWhile his chances of lifting the trophy might be lower than his rivals’, Piastri acknowledged that it would be “pretty cool” to do so.\n“I think it often takes a little while for those kind of things to set in,” the driver from Melbourne said. “At the same time, next season starts in a few weeks, so I think regardless of whatever you’ve achieved in the past, and Max is probably the most qualified to say this, but I think you move on pretty quickly and try to win the next race that’s in front of you.\n“Obviously it would be a very cool achievement, but I’m not getting my hopes up too high. We’ll see what happens. If I can achieve it, then I’d be a pretty happy guy.”\nOne factor offering some hope to Piastri is that, on the last two occasions where more than two drivers arrived at the final race with a chance to win the championship, it was the third-placed competitor who ultimately took the title – that being Kimi Raikkonen in 2007 and Sebastian Vettel in 2010 .\n“It’s a nice stat to have, given that I’m in that position, but just because it’s gone that way once doesn’t mean it will again, so I’m certainly not leaning on that,” Piastri conceded. “But it maybe gives me the tiniest amount of comfort that it is possible.”\nPiastri was also quizzed on whether he had given any thought to the possibility of team orders to support Norris’ championship bid in Abu Dhabi, should a scenario unfold where he finds himself out of contention while Norris is still in with a chance.\n“It’s not something we’ve discussed,” the nine-time race winner responded. “Until I know what’s kind of expected, I don’t really have an answer.”\nIn the meantime, Piastri is focused on the weekend ahead and took a moment to thank his supporters in his native Australia, adding: “I’ll try my best to bring it home for everyone.”"}

Just behind, Alonso lost out the most as he was passed by both Red Bulls, with Verstappen improving to P4 within what was a dream couple of corners for him.\nIt was a less than ideal opening lap for Charles Leclerc, who went wide at Turn 2 and dropped from ninth to 13th, landing him in a midfield DRS train. Things didn’t look much better for his team mate Hamilton, who was still lingering in P18 after failing to improve on his pit lane start.\nAs Piastri sped up the road, establishing a gap of over a second on the first few laps, Verstappen unsuccessfully attempted to overtake Norris for third place before reporting that “the bouncing is still very bad” – he struggled with porpoising throughout Friday’s running and it was evident that the problem had not been fully resolved.\nAs he continued relaying issues with both the radio quality and the car “jumping”, a chunk of Carlos Sainz’s Williams was thrown onto the circuit while he was running in P8, but with Isack Hadjar 1.7s behind, he could afford to manage the damage.\nBack at the front of the field, Piastri appeared to be in a league of his own having extended his lead to two seconds over Russell by Lap 11. The Mercedes driver was warned that tyre degradation could begin to come into play, but the top three were in little danger of changing order.\nThere was more action outside of the points-paying positions as Racing Bulls’ Liam Lawson battled with Leclerc, veering off track while trying to pass the Ferrari. He quickly gave the position back and was not the only one finding difficulty staying within track limits – Tsunoda was revealed to be under investigation for going over the white line too many times, and he was subsequently handed a five-second time penalty.\nThat proved to be good news for Kimi Antonelli, who improved to P6 when Alonso drifted wide at the final corner and looked to gain another position from the Red Bull driver’s penalty if he could stay within the track limits himself.\nHowever, the Italian youngster ended up being handed a time penalty for identical reasons to Tsunoda, ultimately leaving him in sixth place. He nevertheless had a much better Sprint than the Ferrari pair, who scored zero points as Leclerc and Hamilton crossed the line in P13 and P17 respectively.\nOthers who failed to score were Hadjar in P9 and Alex Albon in P10, followed by Gabriel Bortoleto and Ollie Bearman, meaning that Kick Sauber is still the only team without a point from a Sprint this season.\nLawson was 14th ahead of Esteban Ocon and Nico Hulkenberg, with the remaining pit lane starters treating the session as a testing event and pitting for fresh tyres at various stages.\nKey Quote\n\"I mean it's been a good weekend so far,\" said Piastri. \"I think everything went smoothly in the Sprint. I'm happy with how it's been so far, just need to keep it rolling.\"\nWhat's Next\nFollowing the Sprint, the drivers will return to the track for Qualifying for the Qatar Grand Prix at 1800 local time.

But I think after just one session, not too bad.”\nPushed on whether big changes might be needed overnight – or whether the focus would be more on smaller details – the 24-year-old responded: “I think it’s more just little details.\n“The car feels like it’s in a pretty decent place, again just didn’t get the grip out of it in that first soft lap. Some small tweaks, of course – it didn’t feel perfect out there, but nothing major.”\nLooking ahead to Saturday’s Qualifying, Piastri – who claimed his sixth career pole position last time out in Qatar – is hopeful about his chances of putting himself at the front of the grid again this weekend.\n“I think pretty good,” he answered when asked about his prospects of battling for pole. “I think the car’s looked quick – just need to get some more laps under my belt and find my feet a bit more really, that’s all. A few more laps tomorrow, a few more sets of tyres, hopefully we’ll be there.”\nPiastri remains one of three drivers in contention for the World Championship on Sunday, with the nine-time race winner 16 points adrift of fellow McLaren driver Norris and four behind second-placed Max Verstappen ."}

I think that was more or less what we had, so ultimately pretty pleased.”\nHe added: “[We were] just not quite quick enough today, but it sets up a pretty exciting day tomorrow.”\nAsked if he now has the confidence to attack the race, knowing that a significant points swing is required, Piastri said: “Yeah, definitely. I think we made some good improvements from practice yesterday and practice this afternoon.\n“I felt much happier with the car and I felt like I was driving a lot better as well, which helps. I think we’re in a reasonable place with that.\n“Obviously it was not quite quick enough to beat Max today, but I think we did everything we could.”"}

Even with the pressure of his team mate, and championship leader, Lando Norris starting alongside him on the front row and Verstappen behind in P3, he executed a strong launch at lights out.\nJust as he was finding a rhythm and pulling away from the Red Bull , who squeezed past Norris at the start, the Safety Car was called to recover Nico Hulkenberg's stranded Kick Sauber – the German driver had made contact with Pierre Gasly on Lap 7 and retired from the race, damaging the Alpine in the process.\nWith a 25-lap maximum stint limit put on every tyre set this weekend, nearly every team chose to take advantage of the Safety Car conditions and complete one of their two mandatory pit stops. McLaren, however, went against the majority and kept both of their drivers out.\nThe decision gave Piastri an uphill battle as he had to stop twice in normal racing conditions, allowing Verstappen to extend his newfound lead at the front of the field and beat the McLaren driver to the chequered flag by nearly eight seconds.\nAsked to summarise his day, Piastri said: “Pretty gut-wrenching, to be honest. It felt like I drove probably the best weekend I’ve had this year, if not in F1, so to not have the result is painful.\n“Clearly we didn’t get it right tonight. I drove the best race that I could as fast as I could and there was nothing left out there, so I tried my best. It wasn’t to be tonight unfortunately.\n“I think in hindsight it’s pretty obvious what we would’ve done. I’m sure we’ll discuss it as a team.”\nImmediately after the race, he was heard stating over the radio that he was “speechless” and didn’t “have any words”, summarising a wholly frustrating day for the Woking outfit as Norris crossed the line in fourth place.\nGoing into the season finale in Abu Dhabi, Piastri is now 16 points adrift of his team mate’s lead, but Verstappen has overtaken him in the Standings and finds himself with a 12-point deficit to the Briton.\n“It’s not all bad, obviously,” Piastri said. “It’s been a really good weekend. The pace has been very strong but obviously it’s a little bit tough to swallow at the moment.\n“I’ll just try and drive how I did this weekend, that’s all I can do. I obviously need a lot of things to go in my direction so I’ll just try and be as fast as I can and put myself in the best position possible and see what happens.”"}

victory with a sublime pole position for the main event.\nOscar Piastri claimed a crucial pole position for the Qatar Grand Prix, denying McLaren team mate Lando Norris top spot as Max Verstappen made it all three title rivals at the front of the grid.\nNorris initially topped the leaderboard after the opening laps of Q3 at the Lusail International Circuit but, after a short delay to retrieve debris, the Drivers' Championship leader ran wide at Turn 2 on his final effort and backed off.\nIt opened the door for Piastri, the Australian posting a 1m 19.387s which left him 0.108s clear of Norris, who knows victory in Sunday's race will guarantee him a maiden Formula 1 title.\nVerstappen was just over one-tenth further back and needs to finish ahead of Norris to give himself any chance of taking the title to the final round in Abu Dhabi.\nThe top-10 was completed by the Mercedes of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli, Carlos Sainz's Williams, Fernando Alonso (Aston Martin), Pierre Gasly (Alpine) and the Ferrari of Charles Leclerc.\nQualifying results\nFORMULA 1 QATAR AIRWAYS QATAR GRAND PRIX 2025\nNico Hulkenberg once again missed out on a spot in Q3, this time by a margin of just 0.003s, the Kick Sauber driver joined by Liam Lawson's Racing Bulls, Haas' Ollie Bearman and team mate Gabriel Bortoleto.\nThe Brazilian clipped the gravel on his final effort which ultimately cost him, as he was joined by Williams' Alex Albon, who remains under investigation post-session for a pit lane incident.\nYuki Tsunoda's best result of the season in the earlier Sprint was overshadowed by another Q1 elimination, the Red Bull driver missing out by one-tenth as he was joined by Esteban Ocon (Haas) and Lewis Hamilton.\nThe Ferrari driver made it three consecutive Qualifying sessions where he has been knocked out in the opening segment, and he was joined by Lance Stroll (Aston Martin) and Franco Colapinto (Alpine) ahead of Sunday's 57-lap race.\nAS IT HAPPENED\nQ1 – Russell leads the McLarens as Hamilton eliminated again\nWith a Sprint Qualifying and the 19-lap Sprint under their belts, drivers and teams headed into Qualifying with the benefit of competitive and relevant track time on the Lusail International Circuit.\nEven before the light at the end of the pit lane went green the stewards were busy, noting Albon for an unsafe pit lane release into the path of Ocon, with the incident set to be investigated after the session.\nAfter the opening salvos on the soft Pirelli tyre, Piastri sat top of the pile with a 1m 20.739s from Russell, Alonso and Verstappen, the Red Bull driver unhappy with Sainz on his flying lap and complaining of \"jumping\" once again over the radio.\nNorris, meanwhile, was left seven-tenths adrift in the midfield after not extracting the most from his opening effort, as Ferrari's Leclerc and Hamilton were further back in the drop zone initially.\nTrack conditions began to drastically improve, though, Hadjar and Gasly moving to the top of the times with eight minutes of Q1 remaining, suggesting that all drivers would need to run again to make the best of the improving grip.\nThe final benchmark was lowered down to a 1m 20.074s by Russell, the Briton's last effort leaving him 0.083s clear of Norris and Piastri, the McLaren drivers not pushing for final laps.\nThe top-10 was completed by Verstappen, Sainz, Lawson, Bearman, Leclerc, Antonelli and Alonso, all of whom were covered by half a second.\nGasly just made the cut in P15 having lost his final lap time due to track limits, with Tsunoda the first driver eliminated by just one-tenth in P16.\nThe Red Bull driver was joined by Ocon and Hamilton, who was eliminated for the third consecutive time in the opening segment of a Qualifying session, along with Stroll and Colapinto.\nKnocked out: Tsunoda, Ocon, Hamilton, Stroll, Colapinto\nQ2 – Piastri leads Norris as Leclerc just makes the cut\nWhile Piastri moved to the top spot after the opening runs in Q2, Norris was put under pressure having lost his lap time due to Turn 10 track limits, his effort having also been half a second slower than his team mate.\nVerstappen was also half a second adrift in P2 having done a build lap on his set of new soft tyres, before bringing the margin down fractional to 0.335s, ahead of Russell, Sainz and Hadjar at the mid-point.\nWith a new set of soft tyres fitted, Norris comfortably moved into Q3 with his effort just two-tenths slower than Piastri's 1m 19.650s.\nOn the brink of elimination, Leclerc did just enough to jump up to P9 with his final effort having struggled to control his Ferrari throughout, while Hadjar in P10 survived by just 0.003s.\nHulkenberg failed to make the cut, where he was joined by Lawson, Bearman, Bortoleto – who clipped the gravel on his final lap – and Albon.\nKnocked out: Hulkenberg, Lawson, Bearman, Bortoleto, Albon\nQ3 – Small Norris error opens door for Piastri\nNorris dealt the first decisive blow in one of the most crucial Q3 sessions of the season, finishing only 0.035s faster than Piastri, with Russell three-tenths further adrift after the first flying laps.\nVerstappen was left in P4, more than four-tenths back, having bailed out early on his opening lap as Hadjar, Antonelli, Alonso, Sainz and Gasly completed the top-nine.\nLeclerc was left without a time in P10 having suffered a huge high-speed spin on his lap before recovering to the pit lane as a red flag was deployed for a bizarre incident involving Sainz.\nThe Williams driver left the garage with a floor sticker attached to his tyre that came off around the track, the stoppage called to retrieve the debris as the incident was placed under investigation by the stewards.\nAt the resumption, Norris was the first of the leading runners to go out on a lap but running wide at Turn 2 and aborting his lap opened the door for Piastri, who duly took the opportunity.\nThe Australian posted a sublime 1m 19.387s, which left him 0.108s clear of Norris, with Verstappen a further tenth behind, as the order was completed by Russell, Antonelli, Hadjar, Sainz, Alonso, Gasly and Leclerc.\nKey Quote\n\"We left it pretty much the same with some minor tweaks here and there,\" said Piastri after backing up his Sprint victory with pole. \"Everything felt great all weekend so, yeah, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!\n\"It was really good, the team did a great job. We had a little bit of a question mark on which tyres we wanted to use because I did a quick lap on the used set in Q2 – that threw a little bit of a spanner in the works because we didn’t expect it to be so good. Q3 was really good on the new set so I’m very happy.\"\nWhat's Next\nThe 2025 Qatar Grand Prix is set to begin at 1900 local time on Sunday.

The trio of title contenders put on some of the best performances of their careers so far, but who impressed our judges the most across all 24 rounds? Check out the final leaderboard below…\nHow it works\nThroughout 2025, our five-judge panel assessed each driver after every Grand Prix and scored them out of 10 according to their performance across the weekend – taking machinery out of the equation\nOur experts’ scores were then averaged out to produce a race score – with those scores then tallied up across the season on our overall Power Rankings Leaderboard (at the bottom of the page)\nHe may have missed out on a fifth consecutive world title, but our judges handed Max Verstappen the best average score of the season, with his spectacular comeback in the later races making its mark. A perfect score of 10 after the United States Grand Prix, in which he took a clean sweep of Sprint pole, Sprint win, Grand Prix pole and Grand Prix win, showed how far he had progressed in harnessing his Red Bull’s tricky-to-manage performance. Add to that the fact that he claimed more pole positions and victories than any other driver, in spite of the team’s numerous troubles, and Verstappen beats his rivals to the top spot.\nBuilding on his maiden title challenge in 2024, Norris took a host of lessons into this season and was quick to learn from his errors, staying calm under immense pressure to beat both Verstappen and his team mate Oscar Piastri to his first World Championship. He readily admitted that he lost some faith early on as the Aussie took control of the standings, but stunning drives in Austria and Mexico and a composed performance in Abu Dhabi earned him high scores.\nThanks to his superb run of form in the first two-thirds of the season, Piastri takes third spot marginally behind Norris. An impressive streak of eight rounds on the podium between China and Spain established him as a serious contender for the title in just his third year in F1, before he later suffered a frustrating run of six rounds outside of the top three. He bounced back to remain in mathematical contention with a mighty drive in Qatar, but had a slim chance of becoming champion.\nIt wasn’t the easiest year to be a Ferrari driver as the team elected to switch focus to 2026 as early as April, leaving Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton to get by without any aerodynamic upgrades. But the Monegasque driver still found chances to shine, taking seven podium finishes and one pole position before ending the season on a positive note, challenging Norris for third place in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. While he admitted that he felt “very disappointed” with Ferrari's overall performance, Leclerc continued to make the most of a frustrating situation, earning him fourth on our judges' 2025 leaderboard.\nGeorge Russell has well and truly established himself as the leader at Mercedes since Hamilton left, becoming the only driver outside of the three title contenders to win not just one but two Grands Prix, in Canada and Singapore. The performance of the W16 eluded the team at times, but when they got it in the right window, Russell was always prepared to make the most of it. He may still be waiting to get fully stuck into a championship fight himself, but he was able to add a further seven podiums to his tally in addition to the two victories and looked more than ready to consistently compete at the front of the pack.\nRacing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar narrowly missed out on the top 10 in the standings , but he undoubtedly made an impression in his first season in the top tier. Finishing level on points with the experienced Nico Hulkenberg , the Frenchman made regular appearances in Q3 and converted P4 to a remarkable podium finish at the Dutch Grand Prix – the team’s first since 2021. Perhaps the biggest indicator of Hadjar’s strong year is his promotion to Red Bull , where he will drive alongside four-time champion Verstappen next season.\nWhile it was his team mate Carlos Sainz who secured a pair of top-three finishes, Alex Albon’s unrelenting consistency at the start of the season played a significant role in helping Williams to claim P5 in the Constructors', marking their best result since 2017. Spending four seasons with the team, he has been a key figure in delivering frequent points this year, with his highlight being multiple P5 results in Australia, Miami, Imola and the Netherlands.\nAston Martin are yet to rediscover their 2023 form that earned them multiple podiums at the hands of Fernando Alonso , but the former champion nevertheless impressed once again this season. After a rough start saw him retire from three Grands Prix – thanks to a crash in Australia, brake issues in China and engine trouble in Monaco – he broke into the points on 10 occasions in total, with a personal best of P5 at the Hungarian Grand Prix. It's no secret that the team have been focused on taking advantage of the 2026 regulations, but Alonso has still managed to deliver strong results whenever he had the chance.\nThe 2025 class of rookies certainly hit the ground running, and Haas driver Ollie Bearman was no exception. Taking his first points in only the second round, he made a habit of charging through the field as he converted P20 to P10 in Bahrain and drove from the pit lane to sixth at the Dutch Grand Prix. The Briton’s season was marred by a number of incidents that racked up his penalty points, but he made history with an exceptional fourth place finish in Mexico, matching Haas’ best race result since they entered F1 back in 2016.\nKick Sauber went for the tried and tested combination of a veteran driver and rookie for their 2025 line-up in preparation for the Audi takeover in 2026. It proved to be a wise decision, with Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto increasing the team's points total by 64 compared to last season. The German got off to the perfect start at the opener in Australia, crossing the line in seventh to claim more points than Sauber achieved in the entirety of 2024, and further upgrades enabled him to regularly feature in the top 10. His hard work came to a head at the British Grand Prix where, after a whopping 239 race starts, he secured his maiden podium from 19th on the grid and was handed a near-perfect score by our judges.\nMissing out\nSainz and Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli narrowly missed out on the top 10, with the pair ending the season on an average of 6.8. Both experienced the highs of multiple podiums as the Spaniard finished third in Azerbaijan and Qatar, while Antonelli thrived in Canada, Brazil and Las Vegas, but misfortune and errors also led to their team mates outscoring them."}

The Red Bull driver was in commanding form, claiming pole position before wrapping up a dominant eighth victory of the campaign – leaving him only two points adrift of Norris in the final standings.\nIt is no secret that Ferrari have faced a tough run of late, but Charles Leclerc did his utmost to end a challenging year with a positive. After gaining a position at the start to move up into fourth, the Monegasque even looked in contention for a podium at times as his SF-25 came alive.

The Briton needed a podium finish to secure the title – and he ultimately did the job required in order to become the 2025 World Champion, resisting pressure from the likes of Leclerc to hold onto that vital top-three result.\nOn the other side of the McLaren garage, Oscar Piastri ’s title chances were slimmer – but that did not stop the Australian from putting in a determined drive at the Yas Marina Circuit, storming past Norris on Lap 1 to take second place. While he did not have the pace to chase down Verstappen, Piastri’s good weekend ends his season on a better note following a difficult run during the second half of the championship.\nEsteban Ocon completed his first season as a Haas driver with one of his strongest drives from recent races. The Frenchman kept himself in the battle for points throughout, and even held off the chasing Ferrari of Lewis Hamilton towards the end of the Grand Prix to claim seventh place.\nQualifying had not gone well for Nico Hulkenberg , with the Kick Sauber man finding himself down in P18. However, from there he managed to make his way through the field during Sunday’s race, leaving the German “very, very pleased” to score two points with a final result of ninth.\nDespite being the closest challenger to the title contenders in Qualifying – where he took fourth on the grid – Russell faced a tougher outing in the Grand Prix, losing out at the start to Leclerc and Alonso. While the Mercedes was struggling for pace, Russell managed to bring it home in a somewhat lonely P5.\nIn the team’s last weekend under the Sauber name before transitioning to Audi in 2026, Gabriel Bortoleto only just missed out on making it a double-points finish for the squad in Abu Dhabi. The Brazilian initially ran in the top 10, but lost out during the pit stops and had to settle for 11th in the final race of his rookie campaign.\nThere was disappointment for Ollie Bearman at the end of the season finale, with the Briton handed a five-second time penalty for changing direction more than once whilst defending against Lance Stroll, putting him in a final result of P12. However, it was an otherwise solid outing for the Haas driver, marking a continued strong run of form across the second half of the season.\nMissing out\nHamilton just misses out on a place in the top half of this week's Power Rankings, the seven-time World Champion having fought his way to a P8 result after starting the race back in P16."}

We made the right call as a team to box under the Safety Car,\" he said.\n\"That was smart. Of course, I’m super happy to win here and stay in the fight until the end.\"\nMcLaren’s strategy decision backfires\nWith a front row lockout and overtaking extremely difficult around the high-speed turns of the Lusail International Circuit, McLaren sat in a prime position for the Qatar Grand Prix.\nEven with Norris slipping behind Verstappen at the start, the McLaren duo had shown strong pace during the 19-lap Sprint where Piastri had taken victory with Norris third.\nBut the decision to not pit under the Safety Car, which McLaren CEO Zak Brown called \"the wrong decision\" , proved costly both for the race result and in the title battle.\nBy the time both made their second pit stops, Piastri was left P2 but 15s adrift of Verstappen, while things were worse for Norris having struggled to match the pace of his team mate throughout.\nThe Drivers' Championship leader was left in P5 behind Carlos Sainz and Kimi Antonelli, but was handed a position as the Mercedes driver ran wide on the penultimate lap.\nIt means Norris holds a 12-point margin over Verstappen heading to Abu Dhabi, with Piastri a further four points behind, after a race where victory would have guaranteed Norris the title.\nSainz secures an impressive Williams podium\nWith Williams having struggled 12 months ago in Qatar, both Sainz and team mate Alex Albon were realistic about their chances at the weekend.\nBut Sainz entered the race on a good run of form, the Spaniard having started third and finished fifth in Las Vegas after McLaren's double disqualification.\nSpirits were raised after he came away with a point in the Sprint before lining up seventh for the main race.\nHaving moved ahead of both Isack Hadjar and George Russell on the opening lap, Sainz sat P5 before jumping Antonelli in the opening pit stop.\nThereafter, he managed the gap to the Mercedes driver behind and capitalised on McLaren's alternative strategy to move ahead of Norris and secure his second podium of the season after his Baku rostrum.\nHe said: “We came into this weekend thinking it was going to be the most difficult weekend of the year, and suddenly we came out of it with a podium.\"\nFerrari’s struggles continue\nFerrari arrived in Qatar off the back of a difficult weekend in Las Vegas, but instead of bouncing back on a more traditional race track, their poor form continued.\nBoth drivers struggled to get to grips with the car in practice, before Lewis Hamilton suffered the ignominy of an SQ1 exit in Sprint Qualifying.\nCharles Leclerc at least qualified ninth for the Sprint, but he went backwards in the 19-lap dash as his car seemed too much of a handful to keep on the track.\nThe Monegasque driver was vociferous on the radio as he complained about a number of things, with no points scored on Saturday.\nLeclerc did at least score on Sunday after Nico Hulkenberg and Pierre Gasly collided ahead, while Isack Hadjar suffered a late puncture, but he again went backwards off the line before coming home a dispiriting eighth.\nAs for Hamilton, he exited Qualifying in Q1 for the second weekend in a row, and finished outside the points as he looks set to record a season with zero podium appearances.\nAll in all, it was a weekend to forget for the Scuderia.\nThe stars come out to play\nQatar played host to plenty of celebrity guests all weekend, with the Alpine team getting the honour of exercising alongside tennis great Novak Djokovic on the grid – not something that happens every day.\nDjokovic stuck around to hand out the Sprint trophies too, but he was not the only sports star on show in Lusail. Footballers Rio Ferdinand, Steven Gerrard and Gary Neville were on the grid on Sunday, as was David Beckham – those four enjoying the spectacle, but refusing to be drawn on whether they were supporting their fellow countryman, Norris.\nSerena Williams was also in attendance, the former tennis GOAT soaking up the atmosphere on the grid while, away from the world of sport, Metallica were spotted in the pit lane across the weekend as the rock stars got very close to the action.\nAs for the chequered flag, that was waved by Kevin Hart – the actor doing the honour of bringing to a close an electric Qatar Grand Prix.\n1 / 6\nTennis star Novak Djokovic was on hand to present the trophies to the top three in Saturday's Sprint"}

{"title": "Red Bull 'sincerely regret' abuse faced by Kimi Antonelli after 'clearly incorrect' comments", "summary": "Red Bull have stated that comments made about Kimi Antonelli in Qatar were \"clearly incorrect\", after the Mercedes rookie faced abuse online.", "published_time": "2025-12-01T14:04:10.535Z", "url": "https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/red-bull-sincerely-regret-abuse-faced-by-antonelli-after-clearly-incorrect.s4AXZnTR6WuTnqIqcYZQq", "content": "Red Bull have stated that comments made about Kimi Antonelli in Qatar were \"clearly incorrect\", after the Mercedes rookie faced abuse online.\nRed Bull have said they \"sincerely regret\" the online abuse directed towards Kimi Antonelli following \"clearly incorrect\" comments suggesting the Mercedes rookie allowed title contender Lando Norris past in the Qatar Grand Prix.\nWith Max Verstappen on course to win at the Lusail International Circuit, Antonelli found himself running ahead of Norris in the closing stages of the race, thanks to a tyre strategy that had seen Mercedes pit both cars under the early Safety Car. That had gained Antonelli track position on Norris, who had slightly fresher hard tyres in the final stint.\nNorris had closed to within DRS range of Antonelli, who was putting in a defensive masterclass to keep the McLaren at bay whilst also trying to catch up to Carlos Sainz ahead to fight for the final podium position. But with just two laps to go, Antonelli ran deep into a corner and that gave Norris the opportunity he needed to grab P4 and two extra vital points as he looks to secure his maiden title in Abu Dhabi next weekend.\nGianpiero Lambiase, Verstappen’s race engineer, told the reigning champion over the radio: “Not sure what happened to Antonelli Max, looks like he just pulled over and let Norris through.” However, Lambiase was quick to apologise to Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff for the comment, conceding he had not seen the situation fully.\nOn Monday Red Bull released a statement that read: “Comments made before the end of, and immediately after, the Qatar GP suggesting that Mercedes driver Kimi Antonelli had deliberately allowed Lando Norris to overtake him are clearly incorrect.\n\"Replay footage shows Antonelli momentarily losing control of his car, thus allowing Norris to pass him. We sincerely regret that this has led to Antonelli receiving online abuse.”\nFollowing the conclusion of the Qatar Grand Prix, which saw the title battle move on to the finale in Abu Dhabi, Wolff was asked in his post-race media session about the remarks made about Antonelli, describing the notion he would move aside as \"nonsense\".\n“We are fighting for P2 in the championship, which is important for us,\" Wolff explained. \"Kimi is fighting for a potential P3 [in the race].\n“It annoys me, because I'm annoyed with the race itself, how it went. I'm annoyed with the mistake at the end. I'm annoyed with other mistakes and then hearing such nonsense blows my mind.\n“The other thing is that, beyond losing the points for the Constructors' Championship, I spoke to GP [Lambiase]. I saw him and obviously he was emotional in that moment because they [McLaren] needed a P3, I guess, to win the championship or P4, I don't know, but one position… And I said to him, he [Antonelli] just went off.\n“[Antonelli] had a bit of a moment in the previous corner and then less entry speed into that left-hander, put the gas down and at that moment, which can happen, that lost the position. So with GP, everything is clear. He said he didn't see the situation.”\nAs for the race itself, Wolff seemed frustrated that his drivers could not show the full potential of the car. Russell had dropped places at the start, while Antonelli lost out to Sainz – and also on a potential podium – in the first round of pit stops.\n“We had a fast car in the Sprint, and I think we had a fast car today,\" Wolff added. \"When you lose positions on the pit stop and you make mistakes in the race, obviously that's not going to help. I think if you start in free air, you fight in the front.\"\nMercedes are 33 points ahead of Red Bull in the championship , as they look to secure P2 behind McLaren. And while that is some consolation from the final season of the current regulations, Wolff admitted it was a far cry from what he and the team expected of themselves.\n“I think when we look at the statistics in 20 years, you can say there was a P2 in 2013, then there were eight consecutive World Championships, and then there was a P2, P3, P4, P2.\n“I think it's not humiliating. You look at the stats, and you say, well, that's a team that has fought on the front. If we are being totally honest with ourselves, then you need to say that there wasn't a single year [of the regulations] we were really fighting for a World Championship.\n“That is the crux of the matter. I think McLaren has doubled the points than us, almost, and in the previous years it was Max that ruled the world. No one in the team thinks that that's good enough.”"}

Obviously, we want to try and secure P2 in the Constructors’ Championship,” the Briton explained. “It was a bit of a shame we couldn't achieve that in Qatar, but we have a very good shot this weekend and [we’ll] just go out and enjoy the last race of the season.”\nReflecting back on how the squad performed last time out at the Lusail International Circuit, Russell – who finished the race in P6 – suggested that the final result did not necessarily reflect the team’s potential.\n“I think, thanks to Isack [Hadjar] , I had quite a long race in traffic!” Russell remarked. “I think, unfortunately, we were very competitive. I think it was only really Oscar [Piastri] who was more competitive.\n“I think, nine times out of 10 when you are very competitive, the result is there. And I think, unfortunately, this was the one out of 10 times when you do have the car, and unfortunately, it doesn't go the way you hope.\n“And I think that Lap 7 Safety Car, starting on the inside – I think every driver in the first four rows who started on the inside lost at least one position – so that just compromised the whole weekend.”\nWhile Mercedes are yet to have their second place confirmed in the Teams’ Championship, Russell will end the campaign in fourth place of the Drivers’ standings , equalling his previous career-best result in 2022.\nWhen quizzed on which season was the better one for him, the 27-year-old answered: “I think both seasons were very strong. I'd say this season, without doubt, has been my most competitive.\n“I think 2022 was really challenging, experiencing porpoising for the first time and the challenges we were going through as a team and also my first year against Lewis [Hamilton] . But I think this has been a strong year.”\nAlso hoping to secure second place for Mercedes during the Abu Dhabi weekend is Russell’s team mate Kimi Antonelli , who will complete his maiden campaign in the sport at the Yas Marina Circuit.\nReflecting back on his debut season as an F1 driver, Antonelli – who sits in seventh place of the Drivers' Championship – summarised: “It's been going very fast, faster than expected. Melbourne feels not long ago, and I'm actually sad we're already at the end of the season.\n“I would like to have a few more races – of course it’s not possible, but I've been enjoying quite a lot. A season of ups and downs, but we've been having a strong second last part of the season.\n“Definitely a lot of positives to take away and, despite the difficult moments, I have to say I've learnt massively and I grew up a lot as a person and I matured a lot. Really glad, just aiming to finish the season on a high and focus on 2026.”"}

It always tends to feel a bit nicer when you’re driving in the dark and the track is a bit cooler.\n“I think it’s going to be tight in Qualifying, probably between ourselves, Red Bull and Ferrari.

We were only just P3 so we need to try and find a bit more pace overnight.”\nOn the other side of the Mercedes garage, his team mate Kimi Antonelli looked much happier in FP1 , which was the least representative session of the weekend – taking place earlier in the day, the temperatures were higher than they would be in the all-important Qualifying hour or the race.\nThe Italian teenager finished the first session in P4, a little over a tenth away from Norris’ benchmark. In FP2 , he dropped to P10 as the McLaren driver’s advantage opened up, leaving Antonelli 0.667s adrift, but less than three tenths behind Russell.\n“We started the day pretty well,” he summarised. “I think FP2 didn’t really show the pace. The last lap on softs was looking pretty strong, but then I made a mistake in the last corner and lost a lot of time.\n“We’re there in the mix. Of course, McLaren look a step ahead of everyone but the gaps are very, very close and every little mistake can really punish you. I think the long run was much better in FP2 than FP1 so that was a positive. We’ve got to keep working in order to improve for tomorrow.\n“I felt pretty comfortable with the car. We’ve been trying quite a lot of stuff in terms of set-up and we’re going in the right direction, but there’s a lot of work to do.”"}

Preparing for his final lap of the session, he asked his race engineer to let him out behind Verstappen as he would “probably give me a tow” in order to stop a McLaren driver from taking a front row spot.\nThe tactic didn’t quite work out, and he was further hindered by the rear of his car feeling unstable in Q3 – onboards showed him fighting to stay on the track and avoid the barriers, contributing to his eventual P4 finish.\n“Obviously we were near the top of the leaderboard in Q1 and at the top in Q2, but those three around me were on the old tyres and they were matching my lap times,” he later said. “We knew they were going to be a step ahead, and I knew that I had to do something special just to even be in the fight.\n“I wasn’t very happy with Q3 but honestly, anything higher than P4 was not really a possibility today so we’ll take it.\n“I don’t think that we’re in the fight with those three again, but I can’t imagine Max is just going to sit there and let them all drive off into the sunset and finish 1-2-3. There could be opportunities – we’ll play it by ear.\n“For sure, the team are going to be up all night making plans, but I’m pretty confident those plans are going to be pretty different by Lap 1, Lap 2, every single lap of the race. It’ll be an interesting one.”\nHis team mate Kimi Antonelli similarly dropped down in the order as Qualifying went on, going from third in Q1 to 14th in Q2 after putting an eventful FP3 behind him. In the pit lane, the Italian was released straight into Yuki Tsunoda's path and the two collided, damaging both cars.\nThe change in performance throughout Qualifying left Antonelli searching for answers as he explained: “It’s obviously very frustrating. I struggled a lot with the rear in Q2 and it was just difficult. In Q1 I went much quicker than Q2. I’m just really struggling to understand what happened there.\n“I think it’s not going to be an easy race tomorrow. Degradation is going to be big. I just need to maximise the result and try to do the best race possible.”"}

It's so quick, the grip is so high, it feels nice.\"\nWith the Lusail International Circuit consisting of medium- and high-speed corners, overtaking has proved difficult in the past, leading Russell to suggest the order will most likely stay the same after the opening corners in Saturday's race.\n\"I don't want to put a downer on it but Turn 1 is probably going to be where we end up really,\" he said.\n\"We briefly spoke about it this morning in the Drivers' Briefing about why the DRS hasn't been extended and I hope maybe after the Sprint they can adjust it if needed for the race, but it's going to be very challenging to overtake but obviously we're in a good starting position. We'll take it.\"\nTeam mate Kimi Antonelli , meanwhile, was left in P7 having just squeezed through to SQ3 after Isack Hadjar was stripped of his final lap time due to track limits.\nThe young Italian had made a small mistake on his own lap, which in turn meant he lost confidence in the final segment of Sprint Qualifying.\n\"Was a bit of a messy Qualifying on my side. I had a pretty big moment in SQ2 and kind of lost a little bit of confidence,\" he said.\n\"Just didn't maximise the grip today, the potential was very high. I found myself always one step behind so just need to work into the data to understand and in order to be quicker tomorrow.\""}

Sainz finished third in Baku and in Qatar for his two podiums in his debut season for the Grove-based team, but his year ended with a P13 in Abu Dhabi.\n“We were starting 12th and we were the 12th fastest car and with nothing exciting happening in the race we were always going to finish there - with [Lewis] Hamilton making it through the pack to [drop us to] P13,” Sainz explained.\n“Everyone else, we just did everything we could to finish in the points but there was simply not enough pace this weekend, which I hope it serves as a good wake-up call to the team, that after a podium you come back in Abu Dhabi thinking you are going to be strong and we were quite weak this weekend.\n“I’m actually happy this happened, so we go into the winter without falling asleep.”\nAfter losing his 2025 Ferrari seat to Hamilton, Sainz had options on the F1 grid to choose from with Williams boss James Vowles successfully persuading him to pick the Grove-based squad as they plot their way back towards the front of the grid.\nWith their P5 finish this season showing that they are heading in the right direction, Sainz reflected on his first Williams campaign, acknowledging there were plenty of tough times early on.\n“For sure, it has been a very challenging first half to the season,\" he said.\n\"But I hope all that frustration that I got from that first half, as I said, even if we were quick, even if the adaptation was good, if all that frustration meant that then two podiums were meant to come and one podium in the Sprint, I definitely welcome that frustration and that lack of points in the first half.\n“I think in the second half [of the season] I proved to everyone why we made this switch, and what we are trying to achieve here and why I think we are a force to be reckoned with for the future.\n“If you had told me last year we would have scored those podiums and be P5 in the Constructors’ like we are, I would have taken it. And overall, we have to take it as a very positive first year with Williams.”"}

From podium finishes and giant-killing performances to iconic driver pairings and distinctive paint jobs, the Hinwil-based team has left a lasting mark on the sport.\nFounder Peter Sauber was in the paddock for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the final race of the Sauber era, with Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto bringing home the two Kick Sauber cars one last time. With the team set to become Audi from 2026 , now is the moment to celebrate some of Sauber’s most memorable moments and looks that defined their time in the sport...\n1993 – Championship debut\nThe Sauber name entered Formula 1 with a bang at the season-opening South African Grand Prix in March 1993 with the Sauber C12. After success in other categories of racing, the team wasted little time showing they belonged at the top level.\nOn track, JJ Lehto delivered an impressive debut performance for the Swiss team, claiming fifth place in Kyalami, before backing that up with P4 in Imola. It was a result that immediately put Sauber on the map amongst their competitors and signalled the arrival of a team capable of competing with more established names.\nHowever, off track, the C12 was just as striking. Its bold black livery, featuring minimal advertising, stood apart from much of the grid and quickly became one of the most distinctive designs of the 1990s.\n1995 – A maiden podium\nIn less than three full seasons in the sport, Sauber achieved a major breakthrough at the 1995 Italian Grand Prix. Heinz-Harald Frentzen climbed from 10th to third in Monza, taking advantage of 14 drivers failing to finish, resulting in his and Sauber’s first podium.\nThe season was made even more memorable by the team’s partnership with Red Bull, years before their own entrance into F1. This collaboration brought about a distinct white-and-blue livery with instantly recognisable branding. Achieving a podium in this livery was a milestone for Red Bull, and one of their earliest achievements in their motorsport project.\n2001 – Their best championship finish (so far)\nSauber made headlines ahead of the 2001 season when signing 21-year-old rookie Kimi Raikkonen , who many argued didn’t have enough experience. The young Finn quickly hushed them with a string of composed drives, while his team mate Nick Heidfeld provided stability and regular points.\nRemarkably, the Sauber C20 had enough pace and reliability to finish fourth in the Constructors’ Championship, beating the likes of Jordan, BAR and Benetton, despite their limited budget. Heidfeld in Brazil was the highlight of the year, as he kept his cool in the rain to rise from ninth to third to score his maiden podium.\nSauber’s liveries had also begun to show a more confidence – the bold drivers needed a bold paint job to match. While the chassis retained the familiar deeper Red Bull blue from the mid ‘90s, the addition of bright Petronas cyan along the sides since 1997 brought extra colour and contrast, giving the car a look that genuinely stood out on the grid.\n2003 – An epic podium comeback\nIn an otherwise quiet season for the Sauber team, a standout highlight came at the United States Grand Prix in Indianapolis. Frentzen performed yet more miracles in tricky conditions, pitting at the perfect time for wet tyres to fly up the order from 15th to third.\nThe comeback was one of Sauber’s greatest performances, as Frentzen secured his 18th and final F1 podium, only finishing behind the likes of Michael Schumacher and Kimi Raikkonen.\nTeam mate Heidfeld made it a day to remember as he also enjoyed his best result of the season in fifth. Not only this, but the double points finish catapulted Sauber-Petronas up from P9 to P5 in the Constructors’ – an incredible feat in just one weekend!\n2007 – Sauber's best-ever Constructors’ finish\nIn 2006, Sauber took a new direction when partnering with German manufacturer BMW and re-emerging on the grid as BMW Sauber. After a poor 2005 with Jacques Villeneuve and Felipe Massa, the team recovered with a solid season, featuring a podium each for Heidfeld and Robert Kubica, who replaced Villeneuve after round 12. But the best was yet to come.\nFerrari and McLaren were in the midst of a cut-throat battle for the 2007 Championship, but Sauber were able to cause some surprises. Consistency was key, and despite Heidfeld providing just two podiums all season, Sauber were runners-up in the Constructors’, thanks to 26 points finishes and McLaren’s disqualification from the Constructors’ Championship after an espionage controversy.\nA plucky young driver named Sebastian Vettel made his F1 debut in 2007 for Sauber at the United States Grand Prix – after Kubica's heavy crash in Canada. There were signs of his talent early on, as he snagged a point on debut in eighth despite having very little time behind the wheel of an F1 car. Vettel joined the Toro Rosso team after round 11, and the rest is history...\n2008 – Robert Kubica wins in Canada\nOne of the most emotional moments in Sauber’s history came at the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix, where Robert Kubica claimed his first – and ultimately only – victory in F1 . It was BMW Sauber’s maiden win as a constructor, and the only win associated with Sauber. The win was remarkable when you consider the year before Kubica suffered a huge crash at Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, where he was very lucky to come away with just a sprained ankle.\nBut the following year, he returned calm and focussed in the F1.08 – and seemingly had no sense of fear or apprehension. As he later put it, “The crash didn’t come into my mind. I had no thoughts about it. I had a job to do.”\nWhen others faltered with performance or strategy, Kubica didn’t – putting the BMW on the front row on Saturday before pulling clear on Sunday. Team mate Heidfeld followed him home to seal a mind-blowing 1-2 finish for Sauber.\nFor BMW Sauber, the win and 1-2 in Canada marked a step into completely new territory. Taking the chequered flag first that day put Kubica in the lead of the Drivers’ Championship – a position the team had not achieved before. Canada proved to ultimately be the high point of the campaign, as Kubica finished third in the standings, but has undoubtedly remained a fond memory for the team.\n2012 – Four podiums\nThe successful 2008 season for Sauber was followed by struggles for the Swiss outfit. They didn’t nail the new regulations, and although the team managed podiums in Malaysia and Brazil in 2009, they slipped back to sixth overall, before BMW confirmed its F1 withdrawal and sold the team back to Peter Sauber. The team fared little better the following two seasons, but come 2012, Sauber enjoyed a return to the podium not once, but four times!\nSergio Perez earned widespread praise after a brilliant second place finish in Malaysia, followed by a second podium in Canada. The Sauber’s C31 package proved to be relatively competitive all-round, and while results weren’t necessarily consistent, Perez and Kamui Kobayashi continued to deliver in Italy and Japan – the latter a hugely popular home podium for the Japanese driver.\nIn total, Sauber finished the year with four popular podiums, more than Mercedes, and marked one of the team’s most successful seasons.\n2015 – Improvements and bold new livery\nAfter enduring a point-less 2014 season, Sauber bounced back impressively in 2015 as they climbed to eighth in the Constructors’ Championship with their improved C34. Rookie Felipe Nasr proved a welcome addition to the team, finishing fifth on his debut at the Australian Grand Prix, whilst Marcus Ericsson followed him home in eighth to secure double points in their season opener.\nAcross the 19-race season, the pair scored points at nine of the races, a vast improvement from the year before, undoubtedly restoring belief within the team of more improvement to come...\nPerhaps, though, the main talking point of Sauber’s season that year was its bold new blue and yellow livery – shaped by Nasr’s Branco do Brasil backing and additional sponsorship from Chelsea Football Club – giving Sauber a fresh identity during their resurgent season.\n2018 – Rookie Leclerc emerges and ‘Sauber’ farewell\nUnder new team principal Fred Vasseur, Sauber enjoyed another rapid resurgence in 2018, with the Ferrari-powered C37 proving an at-times competitive package. Rookie star Charles Leclerc proved the standout of the season, as he went on to score an impressive 39 of the team’s 48 points, making his mark with a season-high P6 finish. The season ended as the final one under the Sauber name, marking a strong send-off before another rebrand for the team.\nThe C37’s livery proved to be one of the most beloved in their time on the grid – a crisp white with red and black accents gave them a classic look, and the perfect livery for their final season with the Sauber name (at the time!)\n2022 – Alfa Romeo’s rejuvenated season\nAfter their recent rebrand, Alfa Romeo enjoyed a strong season in 2022, with Valtteri Bottas leading the charge and scoring a fantastic 49 of the team’s 56 points, including seven points finishes from the first nine races. Rookie Zhou Guanyu also contributed solid performances to help the team secure a sixth-place finish in the Constructors’ Championship and their best result in a decade.\nHeadlines late in the year confirmed that the team would become the Audi works squad from 2026 – a major new chapter pending...\n2024/5 – The final era\nThe final Sauber liveries certainly made a bold statement on the grid with the neon green and black elements, inspired by their new sponsorships. The colours glowed under the lights at street races, and stood out during day races – and has proved to be one of their most memorable looks.\nOn track, 2024 was a difficult year, the C44 proved slow and early races were plagued by pit stop issues. However, the competitiveness of the car did return in the final rounds, just in time for the penultimate race of the season in Qatar – Zhou Guanyu secured the team’s sole points finish in eighth.\nIn 2025, it was Nico Hulkenberg and rookie Gabriel Bortoleto who helped the team climb to ninth in the standings with 70 points – a huge improvement from four the previous year. Hulkenberg achieved a career milestone when he went on to claim his first-ever podium in 15 years in the sport at the 2025 British Grand Prix, giving Sauber a memorable and fitting farewell."}

From growing up admiring Michael Schumacher to an amusing series of interviews after his driving test, and his passion for superhero comics to a potential side quest tuning cars, the Haas man shares all in the video player above and transcript below…\nCan you describe yourself in three words?\nThree words to describe myself… Motivated, a hard worker, and I don’t know… Maybe I’ll let the people comment on the last one!\nDrop it in the comments…\nExactly!\nWhat made you fall in love with F1? Is there a moment watching on TV as a kid that stands out?\nYeah, I think Michael Schumacher was the driver who made me fall in love with F1. I remember watching the Monaco Grand Prix where he was leading and then suddenly after the tunnel… You couldn’t see back then, the quality in the tunnel was not so great… I saw him with not all the wheels attached to the car , and he lost that race. For some reason, that broke my heart at the time. I didn’t know him so well, I’d heard people talking about him, but those moments shock you as a kid. That is still in there somewhere. It’s quite a moment that strikes me.\nWhen and where did you first drive something?\nThe first time... I remember I had a little Ferrari with pedals. We were living in a very small flat with my parents, my parents put it outside the door for an evening, and I remember the following morning I went to take the car and it wasn’t there – I got it stolen. It was a heartbreaking moment, really. That was the first thing I drove when I was young.\nIt’s sad to hear that… But it worked out okay in the long run!\nYes, yes!\nThere’s a lot of pressure on this next question… How many times did it take you to pass your driving test?\nIt took me one month in total. In France you have to do 20 hours minimum. I passed everything first go. I was very proud because the teacher basically told me, ‘You were the best I’ve had in a while’. I was like, ‘Pretty good, then!’, I was happy. It was quite a stressful time, because there were some journalists who were outside. The [instructor] didn’t know what they were here for, because I was already testing F1 before I got my driving licence. I really didn’t want him to know, because if he had a bad thought, he would not have given it to me, but he said I was the best in a while, so I was happy.\nAlready like going to the TV pen after your driving test, then…\n(Laughs) Basically that, yeah!\nWho’s your best friend inside the paddock?\nIt has to be Lance [Stroll] and Mick [Schumacher]. We really got along super well, also outside the track, so they are my two best friends around the F1 paddock.\nWhich three F1 personalities past or present would you invite to a dinner party and why?\nProbably Ayao [Komatsu, Haas team boss] and Ollie [Bearman, Ocon’s team mate]. I think it would be a fun one.\nKeep it in the family…\nFor sure, yeah. If we’ve got something to celebrate, that’s cool!\nWe know you’re a big fan of Marvel Comics… What is your biggest interest or hobby outside F1?\nThat’s a big passion of mine. I’m really into comics, Marvel Comics in particular. We have some exciting movies coming out next year, which are going to be awesome. A new Spider-Man, new Avengers. It’s going to be really cool, I can’t wait for that. I’ve got something special coming soon as well, which will be very nice, and I hope all the fans will love it! It’s going to come before the end of the year, so stay in touch...\nOutside of that, I like doing sports with the people I love, mountain biking, going to the gym together… But I’m a big petrolhead as well, going to work with my dad on cars, on racing buggies, on go-karts, I like to put my hands into it… RC (Remote Control) cars as well. It’s something I do probably a lot more than a lot of drivers. Probably Fernando [Alonso] is very similar in that case, but I like these things, for sure.\nWhat’s your favourite film of all time?\nI think it contradicts what I said before, because I’m a big fan of Marvel, but my favourite movie is The Dark Knight Rises , so it’s actually Batman, kind of. It’s more The Dark Knight than Batman. That has to be my favourite. It’s DC Comics, and I’m not the biggest fan of DC Comics in general otherwise, but that one with Christian Bale is something insane. Then it’s Iron Man and Spiderman!\nWhat’s the best holiday you’ve been on?\nI think the last holidays that we had with my family were amazing. Going to the sea… I think it doesn’t really matter where you are going, in the end it’s who you spend it with. Going with my love, my family, and I think that’s the best thing. There’s nothing more that matters.\nAnd what about the craziest travel experience you’ve had?\nProbably going to Lapland or something. That’s insane. You land, everything’s frozen, then you get to drive to the hotel or a little house, all the cars have spiked tyres otherwise you don’t move forward, it’s minus 40 [degrees]… Yeah, that’s probably the wildest experience. Seeing people with the dogs that they carry, like Santa!\nWhat’s the best advice you’ve ever received?\nIt’s a good question. I think it has to be from my dad. When I was young, we were sacrificing a lot, I didn’t have a normal kid’s life when I was 10 or 12. He told me, ‘The most important time of your life is now, it’s what’s going to define your future. If we succeed, you will not have any regrets’. That was probably the best piece of advice, because you put everything negative on the side and you just go for it. Yes, I didn’t have a normal childhood, but here I am living the dream and living the best life possible.\nWhich other job do you wish you could try for a day? A superhero, maybe?\n(Laughs) That would be nice! If I could jump in an Iron Man suit and take off… I would like to spend a bit more time tuning cars, but from the electronics point of view. I’ve got a lot of people I know very well who spend a lot of time on dynos, trying to get more power out of the engines. I’m very good at understanding the outside hardware of things, but not the software inside – it’s quite complicated, once you start to put numbers… That’s the bit where I would like to learn a bit more, so doing an internship in some dyno testing would be nice.\nOtherwise, I don’t know, maybe… It’s still related to cars, but swapping seats with some drift championship guys would be nice. Not for too long, but for a day! I did the WRC (World Rally Championship) as well already, which was insane. There are so many things to try, really. I was talking with my girlfriend not too long ago, and obviously I still have a long time to be racing, but I’ve done that all my life. I’ve never really thought about doing something else, because that’s all I wanted to do. One day it will come, and I will have to think about that, so let’s see!\nWhat’s your proudest moment in F1 so far? A few spring to mind, but what’s top of the list?\nWell, it has to be my win in Budapest [in 2021] – that’s the most crazy one. Monaco 2023 was also very special, because that was unexpected, but it was on merit – it was very well-deserved. I’m not going to say Brazil last year was not on merit, because it was, but it’s more conditions that levels up the cars. I take less credit for the Brazil drive than the one in Monaco, for some reason. Even though it was much harder in Brazil than Monaco… Monaco we were not supposed to be on the podium… Also not Brazil! (Laughs) But Monaco rewards you on the dry and it is special, the quali lap, and nailing all the laps in the race. Both are special, but I will definitely take Monaco.\nI think I’ll remember that Brazil weekend for the rest of my life…\nIt was crazy! It was crazy... Especially in a tough time like I had at the end of last year. It reminds me and gives me the confidence that I’m here and I can do it. At the end of the day, I’m here because I’ve proved that I can do it, and it definitely felt nice.\nFinally, where do you want to be in five years’ time?\nWorld Champion!

It wasn't even the fact we were the second car, we shouldn't have done what we did. Simple as that.\"\nNorris was able to move up to fourth on the penultimate lap after a small mistake from Kimi Antonelli ahead, while Norris had his own moment during his second stint after running wide at Turn 14.\nThe Briton said he had \"no idea\" if he had any damage having asked his team to investigate and then struggling to get up to pace on the hard tyre in the final stint.\nThe Qatar GP result means Norris still holds the lead in the Drivers' Championship but by only 12 points from Verstappen, with Piastri 16 points adrift.\nAsked how he felt ahead of the title-decider, Norris replied: \"I feel good. Not the best day but it is what it is. Looking ahead.\""}

So I think there will be some prudency, which is I think what I would recommend, certainly to Lando!\n“He's in a very strong position from this point of view, so I think that's the approach. In terms of the options that Max has available to try and play his cards, honestly I'm not too worried. I think we will see some interesting racing, but I'm sure all this will happen within the boundaries of sportsmanship and fairness.”\nOne option posited to Stella was that Verstappen may attempt to back Norris and Piastri into the clutches of the chasing pack behind – similar to Lewis Hamilton’s attempts to back up then-Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg at the 2016 season finale at the same track.\nBut Stella said he felt that McLaren had the advantage in having both Norris and Piastri up in the top three – with Red Bull’s Yuki Tsunoda having effectively sacrificed his Qualifying to aid Verstappen by giving him a tow, with the Japanese driver set to start P10 in what could be his final F1 race after losing his seat at Red Bull for 2026.\n“I think it's an advantage,” said Stella of the starting position of McLaren’s drivers relative to the Red Bulls. “We have more options to play. At some stage, if you slow down too much, you may be susceptible to being attacked with undercuts.\n“You may expose yourself in terms of being overtaken. So I think definitely it's good that we are there with two cars. That's the position I would take, rather than having the two cars split and separated on track.”\nAsked, meanwhile, about the parallels between 2025 and 2010 – when Stella was the race engineer at Ferrari for Fernando Alonso when the Spaniard lost out at the Abu Dhabi season finale to the Red Bull of Sebastian Vettel, Stella said: “I think the parallel this year fits even better than last year.\n“Last year, we were playing for the Constructors’ Championship, the Drivers’ Championship was already closed as a matter. [In 2025] we go with three drivers into the final race, it's Abu Dhabi.\n“You always want to make sure that you enter these events remembering that it's a privilege to be part of this page of history, of Formula 1, which will be the case independently of the outcome.”"}

That would be the ideal scenario.\n\"I’ve never repeated; every year I’ve always competed in different cars, so I don’t know what [it’s like] twice, doing the same thing, the same job. I think I’m pretty decent at that, so I’m actually confident.”\nWhen it was put to Hadjar that there may be similarities between himself and Verstappen in terms of driving style – and whether this had influenced the decision to promote him – he responded: “With the line-up for next year, they chose it because it makes sense, and of course because it’s a new regulation the timing is just very ideal for me.\n“In terms of styles, Max has a very unique style and I would say [that for] myself as well. I’m not trying to copy what he’s doing but, in terms of mindset, we have some things in common.\n“What I find very impressive with Max is that, after four World Championships, he’s still very hungry, and very mad when it doesn’t go his way because he always wants to win. I don’t think every champion can do that; once you’ve passed a certain level you can maybe slow down a bit in your approach, but he seems to be starting just like I am, so it’s very impressive.”\nAnd when asked what excites him the most about becoming a Red Bull driver, Hadjar pointed to the team’s past – as well as reflecting on the opportunity to race alongside Verstappen.\n“Being in a World Champion team – when I grew up watching Formula 1, I saw [Sebastian] Vettel winning all these races with the Red Bull – and being team mates with Max,” the rookie answered. “I’ll see what it’s like – facing the best ever in the world is definitely super exciting.”"}

As the 2025 edition goes live, we look back at the gifts that caused laughs, mild embarrassment and perfectly captured the friendships within the grid.\nIt’s everyone's favourite time of year again, when the best drivers in the world don Christmas hats and cosplay as Santa Claus for one another. Since 2017, Formula 1's Secret Santa has been one of the most anticipated off-track traditions of the season.\nThe concept is simple: everyone puts their name in a hat (or helmet), and each person pulls out someone else's name to buy a present for. The catch is that the driver doesn’t know who bought their present and has to guess who it’s from...\nOver the years, Secret Santa has delivered some thoughtful gifts, such as the time Lance Stroll gifted Pierre Gasly a personalised Padel racket. But more often than not, the drivers use the tradition for pranks and gag gifts. Who can forget the time Max Verstappen gifted Valtteri Bottas canned fish? A present has never been thrown in the bin quicker!\nWith this year's edition available to watch here , we take a look back at some of the most memorable moments from F1's festive gift exchange.\n1. The retirement reminder\nThe gift: Slippers and a pipe From: Lewis Hamilton To: Felipe Massa Year: 2017\nThe inaugural Secret Santa got off to a hilarious start courtesy of Lewis Hamilton and Felipe Massa! Massa had announced that he would be heading into retirement at the end of 2017, so Hamilton made sure to help him prepare for civilian life – with slippers and a pipe... naturally, for the ultimate \"you're getting old\" gag. Felipe's less-than-thrilled reaction only made it funnier, proving that even legends of the sport aren't immune to a good roast from their peers!\n2. Like father, like fur-son\nThe gift: The Hulk dog costume From: Robert Kubica To: Nico Hulkenberg Year: 2019\nFamously, Nico Hulkenberg 's nickname is \"The Hulk,\" so Robert Kubica took the obvious route and got him a Hulk costume. But, as with many driver Secret Santa's, all is not as it seems... as the costume was for Nico’s dog!\nThe German driver had a good laugh at the sight of Zeus dressed up like the mini superhero, it was one of those gifts that was ridiculous and funny at the same time, which is kind of spot on for Secret Santa.\n3. The face only a driver could love\nThe gift: Wine and Fernando Alonso temporary tattoos From: Fernando Alonso To: Daniel Ricciardo Year: 2021\nWho wouldn't want a sheet of temporary tattoos featuring Fernando Alonso 's face? Daniel Ricciardo certainly was thrilled about it. The Aussie was so excited that he slapped one on immediately. Clearly, sometimes the best gifts are the ones that make absolutely no sense! The question remains: where did Fernando get these made, and how can we get our hands on them?\n4. A bee-utiful gesture\nThe gift: 61 drone bees and Nutella biscuits From: Sebastian Vettel To: Nicholas Latifi Year: 2022\nLeave it to Sebastian Vettel to turn Secret Santa into something genuinely touching. Instead of buying him something, Seb adopted 61 drone bees in Nicholas Latifi's name. The specific number came from how many times the duo had lined up together on the grid, and additionally a nod to his passion for conservation. It was a unique and meaningful gift, and something we think completely sums up Seb. Nicholas was visibly moved, and honestly, so were we.\n5. A picture of bromance\nThe gift: A framed photo of Yuki and Pierre From: Lando Norris To: Yuki Tsunoda Year: 2022\nLando Norris thought he was being cheeky by gifting Yuki Tsunoda a framed photo of himself with former team mate Pierre Gasly. But Yuki's reaction was rather wholesome; he genuinely loved it! After two seasons together at AlphaTauri, the bond between Yuki and Pierre was real, and Lando's ‘joke gift’ turned out to be surprisingly sweet.\n6. The king of gifts\nThe gift: An adopted lion From: Max Verstappen To: Mick Schumacher Year: 2022\nMax Verstappen 's thing has always been the lion, just look at his mascot! In 2022, he decided to spread the pride, by adopting one for Mick Schumacher! The lion, named King, delighted Mick, who immediately asked to visit, pet and play fetch with his new big-cat buddy. It's not every day you get wildlife adoption papers in your Secret Santa haul, but when Max is your gifter, it’s best to expect the unexpected.\n7. The ultimate self-flex\nThe gift: F1 22 video game From: Charles Leclerc To: Max Verstappen Year: 2022\nCharles Leclerc 's note said it all: \"To my biggest fan.\" The gift? A copy of F1 22 featuring Charles front and centre on the cover, whilst one of the original cover stars Max was nowhere to be seen. In fact, Charles had edited the cover, so his face covered all three driver spots! After a season of intense rivalry, this was Charles' way of delivering a cheeky jab, and Max took it like the champion he is.\n8. The tripod incident\nThe gift: A tripod From: Nico Hulkenberg To: Pierre Gasly Year: 2023\nEarlier in 2023, Pierre Gasly revealed during a Grill The Grid episode that his most embarrassing nickname was \"tripod.\" Don’t ask...\nAs it turns out, Nico Hulkenberg was taking notes. Cue Pierre's mortified-but-delighted reaction when he unwrapped an actual tripod. Sometimes the best gifts are the ones that make you want to sink into the floor, because if no one’s been stitched up at least once, is it even Christmas?\n9. The shirtless wonder\nThe gift: Naked torso t-shirt From: Lando Norris To: George Russell Year: 2021\nLando Norris makes the list again with another gag gift. Lando is known for his cheeky sense of humour with his mates, and this gift was peak Lando and George banter. Using a photo of George Russell 's own chiselled torso, Lando skillfully created a T-shirt that George could wear to remind everyone of his... physique. George's reaction? A mix of horror and amusement. The fact that George recognised his own torso almost immediately tells you everything!\n10. The rookie prank\nThe gift: Manual breast pump From: Alex Albon To: Lando Norris Year: 2019\nLando Norris is featured on the list for the third time, but this time as a delighted recipient! Alex Albon and Lando go way back, having raced together through the junior ranks. In 2019, Lando and Alex were two of the rookies on the grid, and Alex made sure to commemorate the occasion the only way he knows how: with a manual breast pump. Was it practical? We can't imagine Lando got much use from it. But, was it memorable? Undoubtedly. That's what happens when your Secret Santa is also one of your best mates!\n11. The Williams welcome\nThe gift: Modelling clay and puzzle From: Carlos Sainz To: Franco Colapinto Year: 2024\nCarlos Sainz was joining Williams for 2025, and Franco Colapinto , driving for the team at the time, saw a golden opportunity. Franco received modelling clay and a puzzle from Carlos that year, prompting the Argentinian to build an F1 car for Carlos to welcome him to Williams in return. However, Franco cheekily tossed out the red clay, saying, \"Carlos won't be needing this anymore.\" Brutal... but brilliant.\n12. The promise kept\nThe gift: A chilli costume From: Zhou Guanyu To: Carlos Sainz Year: 2024\nZhou Guanyu knew exactly what he was doing when he bought Carlos Sainz a chilli costume for Secret Santa in 2024. Carlos has been known as \"Chilli\" for years, but this costume came with strings attached. Carlos promised Zhou that if Sauber scored points before the end of the season, he'd wear the chili suit. Just 72 hours later, Zhou delivered Sauber's only points of the year in Qatar, and Carlos kept his word. A bet's a bet, and the Spaniard brought some spicy Christmas cheer to the Qatar paddock!"}

We look back at the moments that shaped the season off the track and left a lasting mark on the paddock and beyond...\nIt’s been a full-on 2025 for F1 ACADEMY – the third season of the female-only single-seater series. On the track, we were treated to a fantastic title fight between Mercedes’ Doriane Pin and Ferrari’s Maya Weug that went down to the wire in Las Vegas, with Pin emerging victorious after a thrilling weekend of racing. But off the track, the series has grown and grown.\nWhether it was a new Netflix docuseries, the myriad of exciting driver-brand partnerships, or best-selling books from icons of the sport, there’s been plenty for fans to get stuck into over the year. Here are some of the best storylines away from the asphalt...\nThe Netflix launch\nEnter the game-changer. May 2025 saw the launch of F1: The ACADEMY on Netflix – the Reese Witherspoon-produced rewind on the 2024 season, setting the tone for 2025.\nWith unprecedented behind-the-scenes access, the series went deep on what it takes to be an F1 ACADEMY driver – the sacrifices, the triumphs, the person behind the visor – and turned the racers into streaming stars.\nIf you’re thinking Drive to Survive , think a little different: where DTS delivers on Formula 1's glamour and drama, F1: The ACADEMY focuses far more on the raw determination of young women fighting for their place in motorsport.\nThe series proved a hit with the critics – and with the fans, whose deeper connection with the drivers no doubt played a part in the growing audience in the grandstands at races around the globe.\nEarly in the season, fashion and beauty take the grid\n2025 was a statement season for F1 ACADEMY and fashion/beauty brands, and marked many new partners fully committing to the sport for the first time.\nAlba Larsen joined the grid backed by Tommy Hilfiger, with her car carrying the brand’s statement red, white and blue colours throughout the season. However, this partnership extended well beyond the livery, with Larsen bringing the 'Tommy Girl' identity into the paddock and becoming something of a case study as to how personal style can sit comfortably alongside racing. Racing suits and fashion aren't mutually exclusive!\nCharlotte Tilbury remained involved through driver Chloe Chong, continuing a partnership that has become familiar within the series, including providing the makeup for the drivers for the Netflix premiere. For the female-founded beauty brand, the focus stayed on supporting these young drivers as they develop their careers in motorsport, rather than simply increasing visibility of women in the sport.\nWella Professionals were the major new addition to the grid. The global haircare brand already has a history of backing women’s sport, but has now made the move into motorsport for the first time through F1 ACADEMY. Their involvement added another dimension to the grid, centred on confidence and self-expression, and has been backing up and coming star Joanne Ciconte.\nBy the end of the season, these partnerships have clearly become a huge part of F1 ACADEMY’s identity. Not a distraction from the racing, but a reflection of the drivers themselves as modern athletes competing at the highest level while defining who they are and want to be out of the cockpit.\nCanada & the Wella moment\nWhen Joanne Ciconte rolled out for the Canadian round in her new Wella Professionals livery, the internet collectively cheered as the red, mermaid-inspired design took social media by storm. Here was a global beauty brand that believed in F1 ACADEMY enough to make it their first-ever motorsport sponsorship, which made the moment feel way more special than just a fresh paint job.\nThe partnership showed up around the paddock too. Wella, OPI and ghd set up styling stations in the Paddock Club, giving guests and drivers a chance to get quick touch-ups before heading out. Hair, nails, the small details that usually sit far away from a race weekend suddenly felt part of it. A few years ago, that might have raised eyebrows. In Montreal, it just felt normal.\nThe partnership inspired other groundbreaking activations to The Paddock Club over F1 ACADEMY race weekends. Wella, OPI, and ghd set up glam stations where guests – and, of course, drivers – could get race-ready touch-ups all weekend long. Hair styled, nails perfected, and most importantly, confidence boosted before heading trackside. These kinds of beauty services at a race weekend would have been dismissed as frivolous a few years ago. Now, thanks to F1 ACADEMY, they're not only acceptable but embraced as essential parts of both driver preparation and the fan experience.\nFor Ciconte, with her long curly hair, the support provided by Wella stretched beyond the track. \"I used to be really bad at maintaining [my hair],\" she told The Paddock Journal . \"When Wella came on board, they taught me so much, which I really needed.\" It's a small detail that speaks to something larger: F1 ACADEMY is choosing partners who bring real change to the grid, helping these young drivers feel confident in every aspect of their lives, not just behind the wheel. Sometimes it’s the off-track details that help everything else fall into place!\nThe summer of Alba Larsen's rise\nWhile the championship fight played out on track, Tommy Hilfiger racer Alba Larsen was busy elsewhere too. Still only 15 when she started it, her G.I.R.L. (Girls International Racing Lab) initiative began to gather real momentum during the 2025 season. Events across her home nation of Denmark brought over 400 girls into motorsport spaces that felt welcoming from the start, without the pressure or assumptions that tend to usually come with them. Her goals are even bigger for next year, as Alba aims to reach 15,000 girls globally.\nThat hard work off the track didn’t go unnoticed by the racing community. In 2025, Alba received the FIA Women in Motorsport Award, as they recognised the impact G.I.R.L. was already having and the pathway it was starting to open up for young girls looking at racing for the first time.\nWhen she wasn't racing or building a global grassroots movement, Alba was just as busy! Over the summer, she featured in a Vogue Scandinavia profile, she toured with her book The Fastest Girl in the World , and met young fans to sign copies, all while maintaining her racing schedule and making improvements all season long!\nNow at just 17 years old, Alba has cemented herself as the template for the modern F1 ACADEMY driver: a racer by weekend, an author and activist by weekday, and a fashion muse year-round. She understood something fundamental that's reshaping motorsport: cultural impact and track performance aren't separate careers, they're two sides of the same ambition. 2025 was the year Alba proved you don't have to wait until after your racing career to make a difference or an impact off-track. You can do both, simultaneously, and do them brilliantly.\nWild Cards enter the chat\nDuring mid-season, the wild card program delivered one of the year's best storylines. Esmee Kosterman, the Dutch driver who arrived at F1 ACADEMY as the Zandvoort Wild Card with TeamViewer, had everything to prove and nothing guaranteed beyond that race.\nKosterman became the highest points-scoring wild card driver of the entire season, performing so impressively that LEGO Racing signed her for their 2026 debut season. Her success also highlighted something crucial about F1 ACADEMY's philosophy: the doors aren't closed. If you're fast enough and talented enough, there's always a way in. The wild card program proved it in 2025, and it will continue to prove it as Esmee takes her LEGO Racing seat in 2026.\nSusie Wolff tells her story\nIn October, as the championship fight intensified on track, off-track, a different kind of milestone was reached. Managing Director of F1 ACADEMY, Susie Wolff released her memoir, Driven , and it didn’t take long for it to climb the Sunday Times bestseller list.\nThe timing felt perfect – Wolff's story was arriving to fans just as F1 ACADEMY was becoming more visible both inside and outside the paddock. In the book, she looks back at her own journey through motorsport, including the barriers she ran into and the moments that shaped how she approaches the sport now.\nHowever, it isn't just a racing memoir; it's the roadmap for why F1 ACADEMY exists. Every partnership Wolff secured, every wild card driver who got their shot, every girl attending Alba's G.I.R.L. program, they're all living proof of the future Wolff envisioned when she created this series.\nWolff's motorsport journey is at the heart of F1 ACADEMY's successes. Her story and her presence is a big reason why so many young girls want to join the series because they can see themselves in her story, and now, they can see themselves on the grid.\nLas Vegas hits peak pop culture\nIf there was any doubt that F1 ACADEMY had become a cultural phenomenon, Las Vegas erased it sharpish! When the Hello Kitty partnership was unveiled at the most glittering race on the calendar, fans went wild. This iconic collaboration included a merch line featuring Hello Kitty and friends in racing gear, a sequin jacket that became instantly popular, and yes, even a Hello Kitty dog harness (because why not?).\nThe Hello Kitty Fanzone served food and drinks in Hello Kitty packaging that promptly became a collectors item. What's more Hello Kitty even waved the chequered flag following a wild reverse grid race.\nBut don’t be fooled, this partnership wasn't just about selling merch. It has become clear that F1 ACADEMY understands something fundamental about modern sports: you can be serious about driver development while also being fun and engaging for all divisions of your fan base. The two aren't contradictions – they're complements.\nLEGO also made its mark in Vegas, providing LEGO bouquets for the podium. Instead of flowers that wilt, drivers received buildable bouquets they could keep forever, and that fans could buy and build themselves. Even the victory celebrations became shareable, collectable moments. It was another sign of how F1 ACADEMY is rethinking every tradition through a more creative, culturally engaged lens.\nAs the season wound down, the news didn’t really stop. Gatorade announced it would be coming on board for 2026, with a focus on female athlete performance and a sports science stance. The partnership will see them work closely with Lisa Billard, building hydration support around the specific demands she faces as a driver. This goes above and beyond sponsorship, it's research and development for women’s sport, using F1 ACADEMY as a testing ground for performance science that could benefit sportswomen across all sports.\nThe season kicked off with three major announcements that signalled something different was coming. TAG Heuer became the Official Timekeeper, \"reinforcing its commitment to shaping the future of racing, ensuring that talent – not gender – determines success on the track.\" TeamViewer and More than Equal joined as partners, bringing their platforms and resources to the series. Three significant partnerships before the season even started made one thing clear: F1 ACADEMY 2025 wouldn't just be about racing; it would be about cultural relevance.\nLEGO Racing officially confirmed their 2026 entry with Esmee Kosterman behind the wheel. Alba's G.I.R.L. program continues its global expansion with ambitious targets. One announcement rolled into the next, and together they painted a picture of where F1 ACADEMY is heading next.\nThe cultural shift\nThis season made it clear that F1 ACADEMY isn’t just about what happens on track anymore. Fashion, culture, grassroots projects, and racing all found space to coexist, and the drivers were at the centre of it all! The brands getting involved weren’t there to plaster logos on cars, but wanting to work with the drivers, support them in different ways, and trying new things along the way.\nThe Gatorade partnership represents the next evolution: Lisa Billard now has hydration and performance support built around her needs as a female athlete, with the research feeding back into broader sports science. The fashion and beauty collaborations have given drivers a chance to express themselves beyond the helmet. Alba Larson’s G.I.R.L. programme continued to grow, connecting hundreds of girls to motorsport in a way that feels tangible and hopeful.\nAnd then there was Vegas. Hello Kitty waving the chequered flag felt playful and a little surreal, but it went down a treat, and a perfect snapshot of what F1 ACADEMY had become in 2025. Racing, culture, and creativity all at once, with plenty still to come next year!"}

However, the problem reared its head again and the team retired the car for the remainder of FP1, later confirming that it was caused by a sensor issue.\nFP2, on the other hand, saw a much improved performance as he repeatedly set flying laps on soft tyres to finish P4. With everyone finding time in the cooler conditions, Norris extended his lead to 0.363s over his nearest challenger Max Verstappen , leaving Bearman four-tenths away.\nThe result nevertheless marked the end of a fantastic day for Haas, with the 20-year-old remarking over the radio to his race engineer: “Mate, the car is insane! I don’t know how it’s so good.”\nAfter the session, he added: “We had a good car underneath us already in FP1 – I had a great feeling. The first run was a bit understeery but you could feel deep down that the car was wanting to go fast.\n“In FP1, I didn’t get to do a lot of the session. We had a small issue on the car but I did one lap on the medium and we were really competitive. That’s really carried over to this afternoon but I think the key thing is it’s very tight out there.\n“We’re four tenths away but five tenths puts you outside the top 10, so it’s going to be really important to optimise everything for tomorrow.”\nThe small margins separating the field saw Bearman running close to frontrunners like Mercedes’ George Russell, putting him in a good position to chase down his second top-five finish of the season.\nHe previously finished a high-flying fourth at the Mexican Grand Prix, but a DNF last time out in Qatar has left him targeting a strong Qualifying to return to the points, which could be crucial in Haas' battle to leapfrog Aston Martin for P7 in the Standings .\nAsked whether FP2 has encouraged the team to focus more on their one-lap pace rather than longer runs, he replied: “Yeah, it has been the case for us that generally we’re a bit stronger in the race than we are in Qualifying. I think if we bias ourselves a bit towards Qualifying, it’s not going to be an issue regardless.”"}

Whether it’s fierce rivalries or troubling reliability issues, they’ve had their fair share of hurdles to overcome en route to the history books.\nThe Woking outfit have produced a champion in nearly every decade, with Lando Norris becoming the latest to join the illustrious list that includes, among others, legendary drivers like Lewis Hamilton , Ayrton Senna and Niki Lauda. We take a look at how each of these deserved winners fought for their titles with the historic team…\nEmerson Fittipaldi – 1974\nWhen Fittipaldi made a surprise move to McLaren in 1974, it felt like a strange choice – he had already won a title with Lotus, a team that had shown time and again they were one of the greatest throughout the 1960s and 70s. McLaren, on the other hand, had a fairly lacklustre start to their F1 adventure and were far from the success that Colin Chapman’s team had become.\nBut the Brazilian driver identified that, while unproven, Bruce McLaren’s legacy had ambition and enthusiasm, and their 1973 challenger had looked rapid despite its flaws. It didn’t take long for Fittipaldi to harness their updated 1974 car, winning his first race in Round 2 at his home event, and after three more Grands Prix he took the lead in the standings.\nHis performance, while strong, was far from dominant as the points advantage swung constantly – his team mate Denny Hulme and the Ferrari pair of Lauda and Clay Regazzoni all took a turn at the top.\nWhile he only won three races out of 15, additional podiums kept Fittipaldi in the fight alongside Regazzoni, with the pair arriving at the finale at Watkins Glen level on points to lay the foundations for the now iconic McLaren vs Ferrari rivalry. Adding an extra obstacle, both struggled with the track’s bumpy surface and qualified in eighth and ninth, with the Italian starting just ahead.\nFittipaldi knew that his rival was more than willing to take risks, leaving him keen to pass as quickly as possible and avoid Regazzoni shutting the door on him at a later stage. The Ferrari driver actually got the better launch at lights out, but Fittipaldi stuck close behind him and tried to overtake down the inside. As expected, he was left no space and dropped two wheels onto the grass, barely avoiding a spin before he immediately veered back onto the circuit to surprise Regazzoni and surge past. He charged away and built an unassailable gap, eventually crossing the line in fourth and securing the title with 55 points, three clear of his nearest rival.\nJames Hunt – 1976\nFast forward another two seasons and it was no longer McLaren who needed to impress, but the archetypal lovable rogue James Hunt, who had to find a new team after Lord Hesketh announced he no longer had the money to fund the effort to crown the next British World Champion.\nHunt was known to push to the limit both on and off track – he had gained the moniker of ‘Hunt the Shunt’ after some dreadful crashes early in his career – and his playboy lifestyle had been well documented. Yet he immediately made his mark at McLaren by securing pole position at the season opener in Brazil.\nRaw speed helped him start on the front row numerous times, often alongside his main competitor, Ferrari’s Lauda. That wasn’t nearly enough to be considered a title contender from the start, with his explosive emotions and reliability problems frequently knocking him out of races while the Austrian dominated early on.\nThere were more lows to come for Hunt as DNFs and disqualifications thwarted his title challenge, leading to Tyrrell’s Jody Scheckter becoming Lauda’s closest rival in the standings before the Briton’s fortunes finally turned at Paul Ricard. The combination of pole and victory with engine failures for both Ferraris was everything he needed to drag himself back into contention.\n1976 proved to be one of the most defining seasons in F1 history as Lauda suffered his infamous fiery crash at the Nurburgring, where his fuel tank ruptured and the car was engulfed in flames. Miraculously, he only missed two rounds to begin healing his extensive burns and returned to find that Hunt had chipped away at his lead, so much so that he only had a three-point advantage heading into the final round, the first ever Japanese Grand Prix.\nMcLaren booked a private test day to get to grips with the new circuit – call it clever or unfair, but it helped Hunt to take the lead of the race amid pouring rain and fog while Lauda withdrew on the second lap due to the treacherous conditions. A puncture jeopardised the Briton’s chances, but he recovered to P3 and became World Champion by a single point.\nNiki Lauda – 1984\nAfter a three-year sabbatical, and with two titles already won at Ferrari, Lauda joined McLaren in 1982 to partner Alain Prost. The pairing was genius but volatile as both had already established themselves as incredible racers and wanted nothing more than to beat one another, especially as Lauda was coming off the back of scoring just 12 points the previous season.\nThanks to their new Porsche TAG engines, McLaren thrived, winning 12 out of 16 races in what turned out to be the closest Championship fight in F1 history. Prost and Lauda were remarkably evenly matched when it came to victories, and the same applied to their poor reliability too, so much so that a pattern developed over the year – whenever Lauda took nine points for a win, Prost failed to finish the race. But when Prost won, Lauda still added points to his tally and gradually cut down the Frenchman’s lead.\nAs it turned out, even those low scoring weekends were critical, including the rain-soaked Monaco Grand Prix which was cancelled and half points were awarded. Prost took 4.5 for winning, but was nevertheless overshadowed by a young Senna’s awe-inspiring performance in the wet weather.\nMore wins and DNFs meant that the McLaren pair entered the final round with Lauda on 66 points and Prost on 62.5. Despite his lead, it looked as though it would all unravel for the Austrian driver as he ended the season with zero pole positions, qualifying 11th with Prost far ahead in second. After 33 laps, he had worked his way up to third while his team mate led from Nigel Mansell, who suffered a brake issue and spun out to promote Lauda to P2. Without any further drama, that was enough for Lauda to beat Prost to the title by a miniscule margin of half a point.\nAlain Prost – 1985, 1986, 1989\nFor three seasons running, Prost had been denied the Championship by Lauda, Nelson Piquet and Keke Rosberg, leaving him as one of the favourites for the 1985 title. He had spent the years of near-misses honing his race craft, which proved to be his saving grace in a season where McLaren were not the fastest in Qualifying trim – he only took two pole positions, but a superb run saw him stand on the podium in nine of 11 rounds following a flawless drive in Monaco.\nFerrari’s Michele Alboreto was enjoying similarly strong performances, but statement victories in Austria and Italy saw Prost build a 12-point lead over his nearest rival, who would go on to retire from the final four rounds. A P4 finish at Brands Hatch was enough for the Frenchman to cruise to the title, solidifying his status as one of the sport’s greatest drivers.\nMcLaren’s advantage over other teams faded the following year as Williams surged forward, aided by their formidable line-up of Mansell and Piquet. As 2025 also showed, having two brilliant drivers can be a blessing and a curse as they repeatedly took points off one another, allowing Prost to take advantage and secure his second title in 1986.\nWhile others were undoubtedly faster, he was so consistent with his podium finishes that he began the finale in Australia just six points adrift of Mansell, with Piquet a single point further back. He had an outside chance, but needed to win the race no matter what, which is exactly what he did. Goodyear maintained that one set of tyres would last the whole race, a prediction that proved to be Mansell’s undoing as his left-rear gave way, forcing him to weave onto the escape road while Prost stormed to another victory.\nBy that point, ‘The Professor’ had honed his cerebral approach to driving – winning races came naturally to him, but staying out of conflict with both competitors and his own team did not. He would split races into stages, conserving performance before launching a late challenge, whereas his team mate Senna would go flat out constantly, simultaneously endearing fans and infuriating Prost.\nNo other team could match McLaren’s consistency in 1989, so with little competition in terms of constructors, the feud turned inwards and the unprecedented rivalry between Prost and Senna reached its controversial climax. Their collision at the Japanese Grand Prix is still talked about now, but it was the result of months of bitter clashes.\nDespite admitting that they had found differences in each driver’s engines, Team Principal Ron Dennis switched his allegiance from Prost to Senna after a heated Italian Grand Prix where the Frenchman announced he would be leaving for Ferrari in 1990. An incident with the trophy and very passionate tifosi enraged Dennis further, leaving Prost to fight his own battle in the remaining rounds.\nArriving at Suzuka, he was 16 points clear of Senna and would seal the title if the Brazilian retired from either of the final two races. In classic Senna style, he refused to yield when trying to overtake Prost, sending both of them skidding down the escape road. Marshals helped him restart the car and he went on to win the race while the Frenchman retired, but Senna was soon disqualified for cutting the chicane and therefore not completing a full lap, granting Prost his third and final Championship.\nAyrton Senna – 1988, 1990, 1991\nWith the exception of a particularly good year for Williams and Piquet in 1987, McLaren drivers dominated the Championship in the mid- to late-1980s as Prost and Senna shared the titles between them, which sounds a lot more cordial than the reality.\nKeen to reclaim the top spot in 1988, the pair won 15 of the 16 rounds between them as some teams opted to anticipate the following season’s regulation changes that included a mandatory switch to naturally aspirated engines. McLaren instead used a Honda turbocharged engine, which gave them a significant advantage over the other teams and even led to Prost and Senna lapping the entire field on one occasion.\nCome the end of the season, the Frenchman had technically outscored Senna by 11 points, but the system meant that only a driver’s 11 best results counted towards the Championship. With eight wins and three P2 finishes, Senna narrowly beat Prost with 90 points to 87, paving the way for their feud to escalate even further, especially once Prost left for Ferrari.\nIn a direct swap for 1990, Gerhard Berger joined McLaren while Prost mounted the Scuderia’s first title challenge in years. The battle between the two teams was vicious, but Prost had the upper hand after wins in Mexico, France and Britain before his rival bounced back with three more victories in the following five rounds, giving him a nine-point lead in the Standings as they returned to Japan.\nFor the second consecutive year, the duo dramatically crashed out of the race after Senna raged that despite taking pole position, it was Prost who started on the preferred side of the grid. The Brazilian also retired from the final round in Australia, but still managed to win the title by seven points due to the rule that allowed drivers to discount their worst scores from the Championship.\nTheir rivalry wasn’t quite as spirited in 1991, which was the last season to feature the celebrated quartet of Senna, Prost, Piquet and Mansell – they won 93 of the 112 Grands Prix since 1985 – but furious conflict with Ferrari and a lack of reliability prevented Prost from winning any in his final season with the team.\nWith the Frenchman out of contention, Senna faced the challenge of Mansell, who won five races upon his return to Williams while the Brazilian was victorious in seven. For the first time, all points counted towards the Championship, giving Senna a clear advantage as he was a regular fixture on the podium while the Briton suffered five impactful retirements. With the help of team mate Berger, the title was once again decided in Japan, where McLaren secured a 1-2 finish and Senna ultimately beat Mansell by 24 points.\nMika Hakkinen – 1998, 1999\nWilliams went on to flourish for the next few seasons until everything fell into place once again for McLaren, when the new Technical Director Adrian Newey provided Mika Hakkinen with a Championship-worthy car. Having claimed his maiden victory in 1997, the so-called Flying Finn was eager to go even further in his eighth F1 season and was aided greatly by his team mate David Coulthard.\nLearning from the clashes between Prost and Senna, McLaren implemented pre-agreed orders that fuelled their dominance – in the season opener, for example, Coulthard let Hakkinen through after the Finn mistakenly headed to the pits, honouring their deal that whoever led at the first corner would be prioritised.\nQuestions about the legality of McLaren’s braking system arose, but they continued to succeed until a raft of errors and mechanical failures allowed the then two-time World Champion Michael Schumacher to draw level on points with Hakkinen with two rounds remaining. However, any jeopardy quickly vanished as the McLaren driver beat Schumacher with ease in both races to end the season on a neat 100 points.\nTheir battle reared its head again the following year, with Ferrari winning the Teams’ Championship by just four points over the Woking outfit. Like other Champions before him, it was a case of all or nothing for Hakkinen, who either retired or finished on the podium in 15 of the 16 rounds. After a confident start to 1999, Schumacher broke his leg in an incident at Silverstone and was subsequently ruled out of title contention as Eddie Irvine unexpectedly became the senior driver at Ferrari.\nHakkinen wasn’t exactly running away with it as, by Round 12, he led Irvine by just one point, which backfired when Schumacher returned for the penultimate round in Malaysia. Playing the team game, he handed Irvine the lead of the race and backed up the Finn, allowing the Ferrari driver to jump to first in the Standings with a four-point advantage. All that work briefly turned out to be for nothing as the Scuderia were disqualified due to their cars being deemed illegal, but their subsequent appeal was successful and the Championship again went down to the wire.\nMcLaren’s newfound harmonious team dynamic is what secured victory for Hakkinen in Japan, with Coulthard backing Irvine up while the Finn sped away, resisting constant pressure from Schumacher to win with 76 points to Irvine’s 74.\nLewis Hamilton – 2008\nMcLaren have had several stand-out liveries, but a fan favourite is still the chrome design that serves as a reminder of Hamilton's dramatic journey to becoming the youngest champion in F1 history at the time. After he lost out to Kimi Raikkonen the preceding year, the 23-year-old got a new team mate in Heikki Kovalainen to bring an end to the intra-team quarrel with Fernando Alonso .\nThe Briton refined his aggressive driving style from his rookie season and quickly demonstrated that he was a more complete and mature competitor, thriving in a newly united team environment. While his lead in the standings slipped from his grasp as he failed to score at the Canadian and French Grands Prix, he delivered one of his greatest performances at Silverstone and soared to victory with a wet weather masterclass, handing him the top spot which he fiercely defended until the finale.\nAll he needed to do was finish fifth or higher in Brazil to be crowned the first British World Champion since Damon Hill in 1996, and he got off to a strong start by qualifying fourth. Amid heavy rainfall, Hamilton stayed in the top five for 69 laps before running wide, allowing Sebastian Vettel to charge past and leave him in a frustrating sixth place heading onto the final lap.\nWhat rival Felipe Massa, who was confidently leading his home race and looked well on his way to winning the title, didn’t anticipate was Toyota’s Timo Glock staying on slick tyres despite the rain. Struggling to stay on the circuit, he slowed down, giving Hamilton the perfect opportunity to overtake and reclaim a place in the top five to win the Championship by a single point.\nLando Norris – 2025\nLast but by no means least, Norris is the latest to be honoured with the title as a McLaren driver, and like those who came before him, it was an incredibly tight battle to get there. With seven wins to his name, he overcame his team mate Oscar Piastri’s commanding points lead and resisted a late charge from Max Verstappen to become the outfit’s first victor in 17 seasons.\nMcLaren repeated their long-standing habit of deciding the Championship in the final round, where Norris had to finish on the podium in order to outscore his Red Bull rival. Although Piastri passed him on the opening lap, the Briton maintained third place all the way to the chequered flag, earning just enough points to take his maiden crown as Verstappen fell two points short.\nIt remains to be seen whether Norris will replicate the feat in the near future, with McLaren first facing the challenge of capitalising on the upcoming regulation changes . Safe to say, they’re not done producing drivers of World Champion calibre quite yet."}

After Lando Norris became the latest driver to celebrate title glory, we look back at some of the greatest championship-winning celebrations in F1 history.\nIt takes absolutely everything within a Formula 1 driver to get over the line at the end of a gruelling season to win a World Championship. When they finally achieve their goal, the release of emotion is immense. Sometimes it’s tears, sometimes it’s a guttural scream, but it’s always a raw and authentic reaction to dreams coming true. Lando Norris became the latest to experience a championship-winning triumph, clinching his first title thanks to a podium in the season finale at Abu Dhabi.\nWe’ve had plenty of iconic moments over the years, with even more iconic celebrations to match. With Michael Schumacher , Sebastian Vettel and many more to come, let’s have a look at some of the best from F1 history.\n2025 Lando Norris – Abu Dhabi\nGoing into the final race in 2025, there were three drivers in contention for the Drivers’ Championship – the McLaren pair of Oscar Piastri and Norris , along with Red Bull ’s Max Verstappen . The Dutchman almost pulled off a stunning comeback from over 100 points behind, but it was the Brit who took the title by a mere two points.\nWhen Norris crossed the line, the magnitude of his achievement hit him hard. The 26-year-old fought through cries of laughter and tears to thank his team and family on the radio, before composing himself to give the crowd some donuts.\nHugs were shared with his competitors, his mum and dad, his brother and sisters, and his partner, before the customary champagne drenching on the podium. Celebrations went long into the night, including a rousing rendition of Neil Diamond’s Sweet Caroline by our new champion.\n2013 Sebastian Vettel – India\nThe final of Vettel’s historic four consecutive World Championships, 2013 was some of the German’s finest work. He ended the season with nine wins in a row, wrapping up the title with three races to spare. Vettel and Red Bull were an unstoppable duo, winning 13 out of 19 races that year – the fifth-best win-to-race ratio of all time.\nAfter storming to a 30-second victory, Vettel was feeling mischievous, ignoring direct instructions from his race engineer to go to the pit lane. Instead, he drove to the grid and performed some expert donuts for the crowd. Then, he produced one of the most legendary photos in F1 history, climbing out of the cockpit and bowing down to his RB9. The ultimate way to pay homage to one of the greatest cars ever designed.\n2020 Lewis Hamilton – Turkey\nWhile Hamilton ’s 2020 season was characterised by dominance in the technological marvel that was the W11 Mercedes , the Brit reminded everyone in Turkey that when tricky conditions are at play, there’s no-one quite like Lewis Hamilton.\nHe won 11 out of 17 Grands Prix that year, only finishing off the podium three times in the Covid-affected season. The combination of Hamilton’s absurd pace and the car’s innovative dual-axis steering and aero concepts was unstoppable.\nHowever, Turkey tested all the defending champion’s skills; thanks to a fresh surfacing and rain, the track was an ice rink. Hamilton struggled to P7 in Qualifying but used all his experience to decide his own strategy and master the conditions, driving so long on intermediate tyres that they resembled slicks after the race. He won by a staggering 30 seconds, confirming his seventh Drivers’ Championship and a fourth in a row .\nAfter crossing the line, Hamilton remarked: “That's for all the kids out there who dream the impossible. You can do it too man! I believe in you guys!” An inspiring message from a driver who worked so hard to break barriers and achieve his goals. Standing on his car, having won what is currently his last title, an emotional Hamilton raised his arms in the air, producing one of the most recognisable F1 photos in modern times.\n2021 Max Verstappen – Abu Dhabi\nOne of the great F1 seasons deserved one of the great F1 celebrations, and that’s exactly what we got in the title decider at Yas Marina in 2021. Red Bull’s Verstappen and Mercedes’ Hamilton had been going blow for blow all year long, culminating in an Abu Dhabi showdown with both drivers tied on 369.5 points .\nThe Mercedes driver had taken the lead from the pole-sitting Dutchman early on, and looked in control until a late Safety Car with five laps to go.\nRed Bull gambled with a pit stop, and following a controversial Safety Car procedure, Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the final lap of the season to win the first of his World Championships .\nThere was absolute pandemonium in the Red Bull garage, with Verstappen’s race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase screaming the famous line “Oh my lord Max,” on team radio, which was quickly drowned out by Verstappen roaring at the other end of the line. Having spent some time lifted on the shoulders of his team, Verstappen walked onto the podium with the Dutch flag as he became the first Drivers’ Champion from the Netherlands. An unforgettable race, and unforgettable celebration.\n2000 Michael Schumacher – Malaysia and Japan\nThe turn of the century was a game-changing year for both Michael Schumacher and the Ferrari team. Although the German driver had already clinched his first and second World Championship half a decade earlier with Benetton, it was 2000 that sparked the beginning of a world-beating partnership where driver and team went on to win an incredible five championships in a row together.\nThe first iconic championship-winning celebration that year came in Suzuka for the penultimate race of the championship, when Schumacher secured his third World Drivers’ Championship title , and ending Ferrari’s 21-year Drivers’ title drought in the process.\nAfter four seasons of frustration and heartache, the elation was almost too much to bear for Schumacher, who slammed on the steering wheel so hard it broke! Shouts of ‘We did it!’ down the radio, and a shoutout to his wife Corrina – the in-lap was incredibly wholesome, whilst his team were leaping around the garage hugging one another with jubilation and relief.\nSchumacher leapt up onto the top step of the podium with such vigour that he almost slipped right off it, but in a moment that certainly brought a tear to every Ferrari fan’s eye, Team Principal Jean Todt joined Schumacher on the podium and lifted him into the air. It wasn’t long until the celebrations took a rogue turn, with Schumacher driving a forklift through the paddock – and leaving Japan with a hangover that took a few days to recover from...\nThe celebrations continued after the season finale in Malaysia as the team secured the Constructors’ title for the second year in a row. Post-race, Schumacher donned an eye-catching red wig, which we can only imagine might have been some sort of bet with his team!\n2010 Sebastian Vettel – Abu Dhabi\nIn one of the greatest season finale comebacks, a young Vettel came back from a 15-point deficit to win the 2010 Drivers’ Championship with an epic victory in Abu Dhabi , and in doing so became the youngest World Champion ever.\nAside from the race, one of the most memorable moments came from his team radio after taking the chequered flag. After winning the race, Vettel had done all that he could – all he and the Red Bull team had left to do was wait. Between the young German driver and the title was two-time World Champion Fernando Alonso .\nAfter it was confirmed that his title rival had finished down in seventh, so came the infamous radio message from his engineer, “I need to wait. But it’s looking good! You just wait sunshine, you just wait...” And sure enough, the message he’d been waiting for came, “Du bist Weltmeister!”\nThen came the wave of emotion, and the tears on team radio that lasted until way after the podium ceremony. It was a childhood dream come true as he became just the second-ever World Champion from Germany, and Vettel couldn’t quite believe it.\n2005 Fernando Alonso – Brazil\nA fresh-faced 24-year-old Alonso cemented himself as one of the best drivers of his generation in 2005, claiming his first World Championship for Renault at Interlagos . The Spaniard’s unique driving style and fearless mentality was unbeatable that year, and he went into the Brazilian Grand Prix needing a podium to secure the crown with two races still to go.\nDespite the rapid McLaren duo of Juan Pablo Montoya and Kimi Raikkonen finishing in first and second, Alonso coasted home in third, sparking wild celebrations in the paddock as Renault won their first Drivers’ Championship as a constructor. Alonso couldn’t contain his passion, and as he stood on his R25 in the pit lane, he released a guttural scream, before launching himself into his team. He achieved his dream, and boy was he going to celebrate.\n2009 Jenson Button – Brazil\nThe recently retired Button enjoyed his best season with the fledging Brawn GP team, born from the ashes of Honda from the year before. The team quickly realised they had nailed the car for the 2009 regulations, as they were a second quicker than the field in pre-season testing , thanks to their double diffuser . Winning six of the first seven races gave the Brit a big enough lead as the rest of the grid closed the gap in performance.\nHowever, Button still needed a vintage performance to secure the title after a poor Qualifying left him down in P14 in Brazil. Under huge pressure, he carved his way through the field to finish fifth and win the Drivers’ Championship in Brawn’s only season. Button set the tone for an evening of partying by singing Queen’s We Are the Champions on the radio on his in-lap – and it wasn’t a bad rendition after a 71-lap race!\n2016 Nico Rosberg – Abu Dhabi\nRosberg had fought hard in 2014 and 2015 to get the better of his rival and childhood friend Hamilton, but to no avail. But in 2016, the German found a new level of dedication and commitment which allowed him to finally get his hands on the Championship trophy . He raced out the blocks to start the year, winning the first four rounds, before recovering from a difficult spell to consistently finish on the rostrum. Finishing on the podium 16 times from 21 races was enough to give Rosberg the edge over the Brit, thanks to a gutsy performance at Yas Marina.\nDespite Hamilton backing Rosberg into the chasing Vettel and Verstappen, Rosberg held his nerve to take the chequered flag in second . The scenes were wild from Rosberg’s side of the garage, and there was a sweet moment on the radio from his wife, Vivian Sibold, who congratulated Rosberg as he crossed the line.\nSome championship donuts followed, but when he got his hands on the championship trophy at the end of season awards, Rosberg had one last shock up his sleeve. He duly announced his retirement , knowing just how much it had taken out of him to achieve his dream.\n1997 Jacques Villeneuve – Spain\nVilleneuve took to the speed and intensity of F1 with ease, taking pole position on debut in 1996, before narrowly missing out on the title to team mate Damon Hill . But in 1997, it was the Canadian’s turn for success. His season with Williams was littered with wins and retirements – seven and five respectively – but a disqualification in the penultimate race gave Ferrari’s Schumacher a one-point lead heading into the finale in Jerez .\nThe weekend couldn’t have been more dramatic as Schumacher, Villeneuve and Heinz-Harald Frentzen all set the same time to the thousandth of a second in Qualifying, with Villeneuve starting first having the set the lap before the others.\nSchumacher drove away at the start from the pole-sitter, but when Villeneuve attempted a move on Lap 48 for the lead, the Ferrari collided with the Williams, a move that both retired Schumacher from the race and earned him a disqualification from the Drivers’ Championship. Villeneuve limped home over the line to take the title in his sophomore season at just 26 years old.\nThe son of Gilles Villeneuve was held aloft by McLaren’s Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard on the podium, and he soaked in the moment on their shoulders in front of the Spanish crowd."}

With overtaking a challenge at this venue, he will have an uphill battle on his charge to return to the points.\nHe previously said in the Sprint that the car felt even worse than it did in Sprint Qualifying, where he was similarly eliminated in P18, but after a bitterly disappointing Qualifying he admitted: “I was generally feeling better. We made changes and I was feeling better, but just wasn’t quick.”\nHamilton has struggled to find his rhythm in his first campaign with Ferrari, adding that he is “incredibly grateful for the support” and he “wouldn’t have made it through this year without” his fans.\nHis Monegasque team mate was equally despondent after he wound up P10 in Qualifying, more than a second adrift of Oscar Piastri’s pole lap time. A massive spin in Q3 was the result of the oversteer that he has struggled with all weekend, and he has no belief that it will improve before the race.\nAsked to sum up Qualifying, he replied: “Incredibly difficult day, incredibly difficult weekend. I don’t really know what to say. It’s been extremely difficult to drive this car, to keep it on track. I’m trying absolutely everything to extract anything I can from that car, but at the moment this is the only thing that’s possible for now.\n“It’s frustrating. The best thing I can do is reset for tomorrow and try to come back to the track motivated and try to do something special. Am I optimistic for tomorrow? I am not, which is quite rare. Normally I’m a very optimistic person but I have to say that this weekend, there’s zero performance in this car.”\nLeclerc added that he tried to reset for the Sprint, but “it didn’t work out” as he lost four positions and was seen veering wide off the circuit multiple times.\n“I hope it will work better tomorrow, but nothing that I’ve felt with this car makes me think that I will have a better feeling tomorrow,” he said. “I’ll wait and try to maximise whatever is possible tomorrow. With Safety Cars, hopefully we can get a little bit lucky – that’s probably my only hope for tomorrow.”"}

F1.com takes a look back at the milestone moments in this year’s epic fight for the title…\nRound 1, Australia – Norris takes the lead with a chaotic win\nChanging weather conditions ensured that the Australian Grand Prix kicked off the season in dramatic style. After lining up in pole position, Norris held the lead during the early stages from Piastri and Verstappen.\nBut the arrival of heavier rain sent both McLarens onto the grass – and while Norris managed to carry on to the pits, Piastri spun off at the penultimate corner, with all of this allowing Verstappen to move up into P1.\nAfter Verstappen eventually pitted, Norris retook the lead. The Briton faced pressure from the Red Bull man in the latter stages following a Safety Car phase, but did enough to hold his rival off and take victory , sealing an early championship lead in the process. Piastri, meanwhile, managed to recover to a final result of P9.\nRound 2, China – Piastri bounces back\nPiastri’s off at his home race had left him on the back foot in the early stages of the championship fight. Just one week later in China, however, the Australian bounced back in style, putting himself in prime position by grabbing his first-ever Grand Prix pole position.\nAfter fending off an initial challenge from Mercedes’ George Russell to hold the lead, Piastri put in a commanding performance as he stormed to his third career victory .\nNorris followed in second, albeit nearly 10 seconds adrift of his team mate amid a brake issue on his car during the closing stages.\nRound 3, Japan – Verstappen keeps himself in contention\nVerstappen had not looked to have quite the same pace as the McLaren duo in the opening two rounds. This also seemed to be the case during Q1 and Q2 of Qualifying at Round 3 in Japan – until the Dutchman pulled out a stunning lap in Q3 to clinch pole position.\nOn a track where he had previously been victorious at the last three races, Verstappen added a fourth consecutive win to that tally, surviving a slow pit stop en route that saw him briefly go wheel-to-wheel with Norris at the pit exit.\nBehind Verstappen, Piastri tried to attack Norris for second place during the closing stages, but it was the Briton who remained ahead. The result meant that Norris now led the standings by just one point from Verstappen, with Piastri 12 points behind in third.\nRound 4, Bahrain – Another win for Piastri\nWith a different name on the top step of the podium at each of the opening three rounds, Piastri became the first multiple race winner of 2025 by sealing his second victory of the campaign at the Bahrain Grand Prix.\nThe 24-year-old again converted pole into a win , crossing the line with a 15-second advantage over Russell in second. Norris, meanwhile, collected a five-second penalty for being out of position in his grid box – having started back in sixth – but climbed up to a final result of third.\nA difficult day for Verstappen saw the reigning World Champion finish in sixth, resulting in Piastri overtaking him for P2 in the drivers’ standings to now sit just three points away from Norris.\nRound 5, Saudi Arabia – Piastri snatches the championship lead\nQualifying at Round 5 of the campaign in Saudi Arabia proved an eventful affair. The McLaren duo appeared the favourites for pole, yet Norris’ session came to an early end in Q3 when the British driver hit the wall at the exit of Turn 5, leaving him down in P10 for the race.\nPiastri, meanwhile, was beaten to the fastest time by Verstappen. There was early drama between the pair as they went side-by-side when Sunday’s Grand Prix got underway, with Verstappen subsequently being handed a five-second time penalty for cutting the apex into the first corner.\nWhile Norris managed to work his way up to fourth, Piastri scored a third consecutive win – a result that saw him become the new Drivers’ Championship leader by 10 points from his team mate.\nRound 8, Monaco – Norris returns to the top step\nVictories followed for Piastri and Verstappen in Miami and Imola respectively. But when the F1 paddock arrived in Monaco for Round 8, Norris secured an all-important pole position ahead of home favourite Charles Leclerc and the other McLaren of Piastri.\nCome Sunday, Norris kept his composure across Virtual Safety Car phases and a mandated two-pit stop rule to win the iconic race for the first time in his career , marking a special moment for the Briton.\nPiastri’s third place kept him three points clear of Norris in the standings, while Verstappen – who finished the event in fourth – was now 25 points off Piastri in P3.\nRound 10, Canada – Disaster for McLaren as Norris and Piastri collide\nEntering into the 10th round of the campaign, the Canadian Grand Prix, Norris had acknowledged that it was a matter of “when” not “if” in terms of whether he and Piastri would come to blows on track at some point during their scrap for the title.\nThat prediction quickly came true in Montreal. While Russell was leading up ahead – followed by Verstappen and the other Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli – Piastri had Norris on his tail in the fight for P4.\nJust a few laps from the finish, the pair collided on the main straight in an incident that Norris took the blame for . The 26-year-old’s resulting retirement from the race meant that Piastri – who clung on to take fourth – was now 22 points ahead in the Drivers’ Championship.\nRound 11, Austria – Norris beats Piastri in thrilling battle\nFollowing his DNF in Montreal, Norris was in resurgent form at the next race in Austria. The Briton secured pole position at the Red Bull Ring, beating closest challenger Leclerc by over half a second, while Piastri settled for third and Verstappen wound up in seventh after being hindered by a late yellow flag.\nSunday’s Grand Prix was quickly over for Verstappen, who was immediately out on Lap 1 after Antonelli’s Mercedes ran into the Red Bull . What then ensued was an enthralling race-long duel between the McLaren duo, with Piastri making several attempts to overtake Norris.\nThere were several close calls along the way, but Norris managed to keep his team mate at bay to claim his third win of the season . This put the gap between the pair in the championship at 15 points, while Verstappen’s retirement meant that he was now 61 points behind.\nRound 12, Great Britain – A home win for Norris\nPolesitter Verstappen initially led when F1 went racing at Silverstone for Round 12, before Piastri took the lead as the rain started to fall. Both found themselves in trouble soon afterwards, however; Piastri received a 10-second time penalty for slowing too much ahead of a Safety Car restart, while Verstappen dropped backwards due to a spin.\nWhen Piastri served his penalty at his pit stop – with changing conditions seeing the field switch to slick tyres – Norris became the new race leader, and from there the British driver maintained enough of an advantage to take his first home victory .\nAs well as being another memorable moment for Norris, the triumph helped him to close in on Piastri in the standings, with the gap now at eight points. The deficit for Verstappen, meanwhile, had grown to 69 points.\nRound 14, Hungary – Norris resists pressure from Piastri\nLeclerc was the surprise polesitter at the end of Qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix, and the Ferrari driver initially led from Piastri during the opening stages of the race.\nThe picture started to evolve as different strategies played out during the 70-lap encounter, leading to Norris – on a one-stop plan – getting ahead of the two-stopping Leclerc and Piastri.\nA gripping finale saw Piastri chase down Norris for the lead. It was the latter who took victory , however, closing the championship margin back down to nine points in the process. The race was a particularly tough one for Red Bull, meanwhile, with Verstappen crossing the line down in ninth.\nRound 15, Netherlands – A DNF for Norris as Piastri takes victory\nIn terms of milestone moments in the World Championship duel, it appeared at the time that one of the most significant had occurred during the Dutch Grand Prix when F1 returned from its summer break.\nNorris had remained on the tail of Piastri – who had started from pole – through the race, but everything changed when smoke began to emerge from the Briton’s car with a few laps remaining, forcing him to pull off track and retire from the race.\nWith Piastri taking victory and Norris scoring no points, the Australian was now ahead by 34 points – and the situation looked even worse for Verstappen, who now had a sizeable deficit of 104 points to the leader.\nRound 16, Italy – Verstappen returns to winning ways\nWhile Verstappen led up ahead from pole position, there were some intra-team dramas for McLaren on race day at Monza. Norris had been running in second, but a slow pit stop resulted in the Briton dropping behind Piastri.\nThe team made the decision to reinstate the positions, a call that Piastri questioned before following the instruction. Though they were free to race for the remainder of the Grand Prix, Norris stayed ahead in P2.\nVerstappen’s win , meanwhile, had helped him to close in slightly on his rivals in the standings – but there was still a vast amount of ground to make up across the next eight rounds…\nRound 17, Azerbaijan – A nightmare weekend for Piastri\nFew will forget Qualifying for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, an incident-filled session that featured a record six red flags . The final of these was caused by Piastri, who hit the barriers during Q3.\nStarting from P9 on the grid as a result, Piastri’s fortunes did not improve on Sunday. The Australian initially jumped the lights and engaged anti-stall – dropping him to the back of the pack – before crashing at Turn 5, recording his first retirement of the season in the process.\nOn a tricky day for Norris, the #4 driver’s seventh place saw him cut Piastri’s lead to 25 points, while Verstappen’s promising run continued as the Red Bull driver scored a second win in a row .\nRound 18, Singapore – McLaren become Teams’ Champions\nAs polesitter Russell held P1 when the Singapore Grand Prix got underway, Norris clipped the rear of Verstappen’s car and banged wheels with Piastri in a tense scrap behind, leading Piastri to voice his unhappiness about the incident over the team radio.\nLater in the race, Norris tried to chase down Verstappen for P2 before having to settle for third . With Piastri following in fourth, the result meant that McLaren had secured the Teams’ Championship for a second consecutive year.\nIn the Drivers’ Championship, Norris now sat 22 points behind Piastri, with Verstappen having reduced his own deficit to 63 points.\nRound 19, United States – Verstappen’s comeback continues\nDisaster struck for McLaren moments into the Sprint at the Circuit of The Americas, with both Norris and Piastri taken out on the opening lap after being caught up in a Turn 1 melee.\nVerstappen went on to win the 100km dash , and the Dutchman continued the rest of the weekend in that form, grabbing pole position before surging to another Grand Prix win , his third in four races. Norris and Piastri, meanwhile, claimed second and fifth respectively.\nThe title fight had taken another twist, with Piastri’s lead down to 14 points over Norris and 40 from Verstappen.\nRound 20, Mexico City – Norris retakes championship lead\nJust a few days on from Austin, things could not have gone much better for Norris during Round 20 in Mexico City.\nAfter beating Leclerc to pole position by 0.262s – while Piastri was nearly eight-tenths back in P8 – Norris converted that position into a lights-to-flag victory come Sunday, a result that reinstated him as the Drivers’ Championship leader by just one point from his team mate.\nVerstappen took the final spot on the podium alongside Norris and Leclerc, putting the Dutchman 36 points behind Norris in the standings.\nRound 21, Sao Paulo – A dream weekend for Norris\nNorris followed up that impressive Mexico performance with another strong outing in Sao Paulo, starting with a win in the penultimate Sprint of the year – an event in which Piastri crashed out amid changeable conditions.\nPole position followed for Norris later on Saturday during a fascinating Qualifying session that saw Verstappen shockingly exit in Q1 , leaving him down in 17th. Red Bull subsequently opted to start the four-time World Champion from the pit lane.\nAnother triumph for Norris boosted the Briton’s advantage in the championship to 24 points over Piastri, while a stunning drive from Verstappen – in which he climbed up to P3 – reduced the potential damage in the standings.\nRound 22, Las Vegas – Double disqualification for McLaren\nAs the season reached its final triple header sequence, it remained all to play for in the title fight. Leader Norris outpaced Verstappen to seize pole position in Las Vegas, but a bold defensive move from the former into Turn 1 failed to pay off, allowing Verstappen through into the lead.\nThe Red Bull man resisted an early challenge from Russell and stormed to his sixth win of the campaign , with Norris and Piastri initially taking second and fourth respectively. However, it was later announced that the McLaren drivers had been disqualified due to the rearmost skid wear on both cars being found to be below the minimum thickness required in the technical regulations.\nThis outcome had a significant effect on the Drivers’ Championship; Verstappen had now drawn equal with Piastri in second place, with both sitting 24 points behind Norris.\nRound 23, Qatar – Verstappen moves even closer\nNorris arrived into the penultimate event of the season in Qatar with a chance to wrap up the championship – but it was Piastri who returned to winning ways in the Sprint , a result he followed up by taking pole later on Saturday in Qualifying.\nMcLaren’s hopes of claiming victory on Sunday looked to have been dashed, however, when they opted for an alternative strategy to the majority of the field. While most of the grid pitted for the first of a mandatory two-stop strategy when the Safety Car was deployed on Lap 7, the papaya cars stayed out on track.\nAs such, they dropped backwards when they eventually made their stops, and Piastri and Norris finished the race in second and fourth. Verstappen had added another victory to his tally – and this meant that the Dutch driver would enter the finale just 12 points behind Norris, with Piastri now 16 adrift of his team mate.\nRound 24, Abu Dhabi – The title is decided\nTo become World Champion, Norris needed to finish the season finale in Abu Dhabi on the podium. However, that task was not necessarily made easy for the Briton as the action got underway at the Yas Marina Circuit, with polesitter Verstappen leading from the off while Piastri overtook Norris for P2.\nThere was then significant pressure on the championship leader as a racy Leclerc tried to attack for P3, while there was also a tense wheel-to-wheel moment later on with the Red Bull of Yuki Tsunoda .\nDespite this, Norris maintained composure and did enough to secure that vital third place on track behind Verstappen and Piastri – a result that gave Norris his maiden title by just two points from Verstappen, bringing a thrilling championship duel to a close."}

But Norris is sandwiched between them, with a Verstappen victory good enough to give the Dutchman his fifth title in a row if Norris is fourth or lower.\nUnlock exclusive F1 content and more with F1 Unlocked.

It’s been evidenced through our successful TPC running this season but there’s been so much more going on behind the scenes too – including the development and installation of the simulator at our Banbury facility for 2026.\n\"The cultivation of personnel, all working collaboratively between Haas F1 Team and TGR, has benefited us greatly and that’s something that will only increase as our partnership matures.\n\"We’re excited to further grow with the likes of our driver program too, and it’s been encouraging to see the depth of talent TGR is backing in that process.”\nChairman of Toyota Motor Corporation Akio Toyoda said: \"Throughout our challenges in the 2025 season, I witnessed young TGR drivers and engineers begin to believe in their own potential and set their sights on even greater dreams.\n“Seeing this transformation moved me deeply. And today, I can say this with confidence, Toyota has finally begun to move – really move. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Gene Haas and Ayao Komatsu for standing alongside our young members, believing in their potential, and facing the future with the same passion and perspective.\n\"By taking our partnership with Haas another step forward next year, TGR’s ‘People, Product, Pipeline’ mantra – will accelerate in a way we have never seen before.\n\"The time has come for the next generation to take their first steps toward the world stage. Together with Gene Haas, Ayao, and everyone at TGR Haas F1 Team, we will build both a culture and a team for the future. Toyota is now truly on the move.”\nThe improved Toyota arrangement will run alongside Haas' existing deal with Ferrari, which began when they entered the sport in 2016 and includes the supply of the Italian team's power unit and gearbox, plus other selected parts and use of the Ferrari's simulator at Maranello.\nHaas also confirmed they will unveil their 2026 livery online on January 23 before heading to Barcelona for private testing, which commences on January 26.\nThe American squad are currently eighth in the Teams' Championship, just seven points behind Aston Martin with one round to go in Abu Dhabi this weekend."}

{"title": "TREMAYNE: Why I’ll miss ‘true racer’ Marko as he bows out of Red Bull", "summary": "As Helmut Marko retires, another precious link with F1’s glorious past snaps, says David Tremayne…", "published_time": "2025-12-09T17:22:20.328Z", "url": "https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/tremayne-why-ill-miss-true-racer-marko-as-he-bows-out-of-red-bull.1XclRVzbUSmU50J36viqbA", "content": "As Helmut Marko retires, another precious link with F1’s glorious past is gone, says David Tremayne…\nTo many people in the paddock these days, I suspect the 82-year-old Austrian Helmut Marko was probably just ‘that crotchety old guy at Red Bull who always says exactly what he's thinking.’ Most were probably wary of approaching him.\nI’m happy to say I loved and respected him. And as I said to Mark Webber’s partner Ann Neal, back in the Multi-21 days when she suggested that he “couldn’t do” some of the things he was doing, you had to know Helmut and his background first before you could truly understand him.\nIf you believed everything you heard about him, you'd think he was a tyrant, a bully who had no qualms about smashing young drivers’ careers without a second thought if they failed to get the job done. But he was raised in the school of hard knocks, where you stood for yourself.\nHe and Jochen Rindt , who would become the sport’s only posthumous World Champion in 1970, were good buddies. Each had that wanton wildness during their school days that would prove sound preparation for the racing world that awaited them, but accelerated their expulsion from the Pestalozzi School in Graz.\n“Let’s put it this way,” Helmut once explained of his removal from the school with a chuckle. “If we left, they would give us a positive report. If not, we wouldn’t make it. So it was a very attractive offer. We messed about, we skipped lessons. We were a wild age and we really didn’t fit in this system of nice boys.\n“So then we went to a boarding school called Bad Aussee, in the mountains, and that was a really wild time because whatever you had to do, you had to organise yourself. Climbing out of the windows during the night…”\nFirst they raced each other on their ‘wombats’ (mopeds), later in cars, on the roads around Graz. The deal was that each would drive whichever car was available, until they made a mistake, whereupon they would be replaced. If there was more than one car, the deal was that if you stuffed it, you were on your own. Helmut once spun his father’s Chevrolet, ‘borrowed’ without paternal permission, down a hill. Get out of that! Thus, the young electrical dealer’s son was used to fending for himself.\nIt's largely overlooked now, but he was a damn good driver himself, and after Jochen’s death at Monza in September 1970 he focused on his own career. He was a topline European 2-litre sportscar racer in a Lola T212, as Brian Redman will attest, and won Le Mans in 1971 in a Martini Porsche 917K with co-driver Gijs van Lennep.\nHe got his first chance in F1 with BRM in 1971. The team was a shambles as Louis Stanley sought to run five cars, and it wasn’t until 1972, and the French GP at Clermont Ferrand, that Helmut finally got a halfway decent P160B instead of an old nail P153.\nHe qualified it sixth on this mini-Nurburgring, and was dicing for fourth with Ronnie Peterson in a March 721G and champion-elect Emerson Fittipaldi in a Lotus 72, the leading BRM driver by a country mile. The track was littered with stones, and one was thrown up from one of their wheels, went through his visor like a bullet, and struck him straight in the eye.\nHe was the man who could have been Niki Lauda before Niki Lauda. But in that moment his racing career ended.\n“It was all coming together,” he remembered. “And funnily enough I had just got some autographs to sign and there were photos of me in my 153 and one in the 160. In the 153 I was sitting properly, in the 160 I remember that it came late – like it always did with BRM! – and I was sitting about 10cm higher. They couldn’t adjust the seat properly for the race. If I would have been in my normal seating position, nothing would have happened.\n“I didn’t know immediately that I was in trouble. I saw something coming. I just remembered I was sixth and we had 258 litres of fuel and there were 18 cars behind me, so if I don’t do something smart, they could hit me. I managed to raise my arm and park the car, fortunately for me and the others.\n“I was for two months in hospital and I had stitches in my injured eye and I couldn’t see because I had covers on both eyes. Then you are thinking a lot. At one stage I said, ‘That’s it!’ I was 29, the victim of an accident… One night it was clear that it wouldn’t be the same as it was before… But life goes forward, and I had to cope with that.\n“Of course I was bitter in the beginning. It was, ‘Oh, by Christ,’ but being in the hospital you see or you hear what is going on around you, so then you relatively see that it is not so serious. You have to get normal again, and stay grounded.”\nYears later, I was speaking to him about his protégé Helmuth Koinigg, who would lose his life in the 1974 US GP. Helmut said Koinigg’s Formula Vee sponsor wanted the pair of them to do a hillclimb. Helmut told Little Helmuth he would only do it if he could have a specific car, the one that his protégé wanted – because it was quicker. Of course, Big Helmut prevailed and duly won. And then he told me the most extraordinary story.\nHeading home he read in a newspaper of the crash of scheduled Alitalia flight 112 when the airline’s Douglas DC-8-43, flying from the Leonardo da Vinci Airport in Rome to Palermo International Airport, flew into Sicily’s Mount Longa. In Italy’s biggest single aircraft disaster, all 108 passengers and seven crew were killed.\n“If I hadn’t done that hillclimb I would have been on that flight, heading out to test for Alfa Romeo for the Targa Florio,” he said nonchalantly as we sat outside one of the attractive little hospitality units in the paddock in China.\n“Man, I’ve never seen that written anywhere!” I exclaimed.\n“That’s because I never told anyone,” Helmut said, as if it was no big deal.\nImagine… That had occurred on May 5. He would have been entitled to feel that the gods were smiling upon him. Then, in a flash on July 2, that stone took his eye and his career was over… Such cruel fortune…\nHe took up running his own hotel, and then ventured back into racing by setting up his own Formula 3000 team. Along the way he worked with another doomed young Austrian, Markus Hottinger, who was killed in a Formula 2 race at Hockenheim in 1980.\n“There was this thing with the Austrians, that they had such odd accidents,” he recalled quietly. “With Jochen it was under braking and the nose wedged beneath the guardrail at Monza and it was torn off and he was pulled out of the car. Two metres earlier or later...\n\"Fortunately I was not at Watkins Glen when Helmuth was killed. That was a big shock. He had a puncture and went under the guardrail, and was decapitated. And with Hottinger, a wheel from Derek Warwick’s car was bouncing around and it hit his head…\n“Both Helmuth and Markus gave something to racing… And, yes, both of them could have made it.” He paused for a moment in his reflection, then said, as he had with his own incident, “But life goes on…”\nSo that all goes a long way to explaining why he has left the racing battlefield strewn with the careers of the myriad drivers who failed to go all the way through Red Bull ’s youth programme: Tonio Liuzzi; Patrick Friesacher; Sebastian Bourdais; Scott Speed; Sebastien Buemi; Jaime Alguersuari; Lewis Williamson; Christian Klien; Pierre Gasly ; Alex Albon ; Sergio Perez; Liam Lawson ; Yuki Tsunoda .\nWith his famed, Lauda-matching Austrian pragmatism, he has always sought the best, looked for those drivers prepared to go the extra mile to succeed. He’s never been one to wrap an avuncular arm around a struggling racer. And he found what he was looking for with Sebastian Vettel and, later Max Verstappen .\nHe admits cheerfully that back in the dark days after his career ended in 1972, he never dreamed he would get a second chance in Formula 1. “No, not at all. But the chance came fortunately through Red Bull with the Jaguar team.”\nHe and the great Dietrich Mateschitz knew one another in Styria long before their collaboration at Red Bull began. “I was the one who said Christian [Horner] is our man, and I’m glad I did,” he said a few years ago, before the death of Mateschitz and Horner's departure from the team earlier this year.\n“In the beginning, a lot of experts said it couldn’t work, but he’s proved that he’s capable. I saw how he was running his F3000 team; we were young and we were different, and we made the old-established people see differently. It made sense. Here, it’s very open, and we don’t tell stories. We just try to find the best solution for the team, and we do it without any egos.\n“I don’t handle the daily operations. That rests with Christian. If it’s a major decision, either I decide or else if necessary I take it to Didi [Mateschitz].”\nChristian didn’t always agree with Helmut’s version of how they worked together, but the fact is that the old warrior played a key role in forming the team, and together they would take it to such fantastic success.\nAs of today, Red Bull Racing have won 130 Grands Prix, eight Drivers’ and six Constructors’ World Championships, toppling the likes of Ferrari and Mercedes along the way.\nSadly, it now looks like it is time for him to saddle up. Times change, but it makes me sad. No matter what you thought about the way he operated, Helmut Marko was a true racer on and off the track, with the scars to prove it, a great sense of humour and a refreshing penchant for saying exactly what he thought. He leaves a significant, often overlooked legacy, and I for one will miss his huge presence in the paddock."}

But that position does not tell the full story of what happened in a thrilling season finale.\nStarting from P10, Tsunoda was put on the hard compound tyre with one aim – to wind up ahead of Championship leader Lando Norris and do his best to disrupt the McLaren man and cost him track time, all in a bid to aid Max Verstappen’s Championship challenge.\nTsunoda’s game plan worked to the extent that he found Norris behind him midway through the race. But he was unable to keep the freshly-shod McLaren at bay, and in battling hard with Norris, Tsunoda was handed a penalty by the stewards to boot.\nHe received a five-second time penalty to serve at his own pit stop for “more than one change of direction to defend position” and his defence had even involved pushing Norris as wide as possible when the McLaren drew up alongside, Norris winding up with all four wheels off the track as a result.\n“Car 4 was making an overtaking move on Car 22,” read the document from the FIA explaining Tsunoda's penalty. \"Car 22 made a number of changes of direction which ultimately resulted in Car 4 having to go off track to avoid a collision. In doing so, Car 22 also effectively forced Car 4 off the track.\"\n“I really tried my absolute best to score points today, and I think there could have been potential to do so, but the penalty made it tricky,” explained Tsunoda after the race. “We opted for a different strategy, and we were running well until the battle with Lando. I tried to hold him up, but he was pretty fast, and then I ended up with a frustrating penalty.”\nTsunoda now bows out of a fulltime F1 seat as he sees his cockpit at Red Bull filled by Isack Hadjar for next season, instead becoming the team’s reserve driver. But he was quick to thank his mechanics for all their hard work on his car this year – including through various set-up changes.\n“I enjoyed a lot with the mechanics especially, the amount of support I had from them was phenomenal,\" Tsunoda added. \"Probably some phases they were hating me because of a lot of overnight changes, a lot of you know massive set-up changes between FP3 and Qualifying.\n\"I told them yesterday, at least I trained them well, they are very sharp. Yeah, I’m sure they appreciated me.\"\n“This year, if I look back at just the word called luck – I don’t want to say or use the word called luck to be honest. But I felt deeply unlucky… Every race weekend, something went on. This weekend, had to revert back to the old floor without my control you know with that incident in the pit lane [with Antonelli].\n“Never had a straightforward race but at least I gave it all, I think I’ve shown what I can do.”\nTsunoda was on the F1 grid for five straight seasons, joining what was then AlphaTauri in 2021 and racing for the team all the way to the start of this season, when he was promoted to Red Bull after two races in place of Liam Lawson . And while he was disappointed to lose his seat, Tsunoda has at least learned plenty from driving and working alongside Verstappen this season.\n”He is the best driver on the grid, seeing him work and extract everything that he does is, just shows how good he is, and he has the mentality to go with it, it's very inspiring to see,” concluded Tsunoda."}

It meant that we decided very early in the season – I think it was the end of April – to switch to '26.\n“It was a tough call. Perhaps I also underestimated a little bit the call on the psychological side, because when you still have 20 races to go, or 18 races to go, and you know that you won’t bring any aero development, it's quite tough to manage psychologically. But overall, we continued to push.\n“We brought some mechanical upgrades, and we are trying to do a better job operationally, and this is the DNA of our sport. We have to accept this. It was a call, and I’m still confident with the call that we made.”\nWhile Red Bull were able to gradually close the competitive gap to McLaren at the hands of Max Verstappen, and Mercedes picked up two victories for George Russell, Ferrari were unable to stick with their rivals despite some more promising weekends.\nLeclerc’s numerous podiums and sole pole position, as well as Hamilton’s early Sprint win in China, were the team’s high points in an inconsistent season, leading to the Monegasque driver admitting he felt “very disappointed” with their results.\nNevertheless, Vasseur insisted that the focus on 2026 was not fully to blame, explaining: “This decision was shared by everybody in the team. At one stage, you look at the championship and say, 'Okay, it will be very difficult to come back on McLaren with the delta pace, the delta points.' So you say, Okay, let’s focus the resources we have in the wind tunnel on 2026.'\n“On the other hand, we can still continue to develop the mechanical side and bring some upgrades on the car, except aero. And that’s what we did – and it was a good exercise, honestly.\n“For sure, the drivers were part of this decision. They are fully committed to the project. It’s something we have to share altogether. In this kind of situation, you have to act as a team, and that’s what we did in that stage of the season.”\nThe Frenchman added that the hurdles they faced this year will aid their resilience in 2026, when new rivals in Audi and Cadillac and fresh challenges with a redesigned power unit will force the team to adapt quickly.\n“You always have positives, even in a tough season,” he said. “I think we had a decent recovery in terms of performance. We were back on the podium – Mexico, Austin. I would say in São Paulo we were not far away. That means we were on the right way.\n“It’s good for the team, at least for the psychological side. You always improve a little bit everywhere, in every single area. It's the best preparation for 2026. But the most important of this call... is that we agreed quite early that we would put a maximum of energy on the future.\n“That means then we have to react as a team, even when you have tough weekends, to come back Monday morning at the factory and continue to push and develop and work all together. We had a good reaction to tough sessions and tough weekends. Let's see next year if we did a good job this season also.”"}

Piastri, meanwhile, took third place as the top three prepare to battle for the World Championship on Sunday.\nRussell ended the session in fourth for Mercedes, while Charles Leclerc claimed fifth and Fernando Alonso took a solid sixth in the Aston Martin. Gabriel Bortoleto put in a good drive for Kick Sauber in seventh, with Haas’ Esteban Ocon, the Racing Bulls of Isack Hadjar and Yuki Tsunoda – in his final Qualifying for Red Bull – completing the top 10.\nQualifying results\nFORMULA 1 ETIHAD AIRWAYS ABU DHABI GRAND PRIX 2025\nDespite strong pace through the weekend so far, Haas’ Ollie Bearman missed the cut for Q2 – as did Carlos Sainz, the Williams man ending up in P12 one week on from his podium in Qatar.\nLiam Lawson followed in 13th for Racing Bulls, while Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli departed Q2 in 14th place – the Italian having reported struggles with the rear of his car – ahead of the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll in 15th.\nThe big story from Q1 was another early exit for Lewis Hamilton, the Ferrari driver finding himself down in P16 just hours after a crash into the barriers during third practice. There was also disappointment for Williams’ Alex Albon, who will line up one spot behind in P17.\nA good showing for Nico Hulkenberg on Friday did not follow through come Qualifying, with the Kick Sauber man winding up in 18th, while the Alpine pair of Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto brought up the rear in 19th and 20th respectively.\nAS IT HAPPENED\nQ1 – Piastri quickest as Hamilton exits\nAfter an eventful practice session earlier in the day – topped by the Mercedes of Russell – the attentions of the paddock switched to the final Qualifying of the year, a crucial session in that it would set the starting order for the title-deciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.\nAs Q1 got underway under the floodlights at 1800 local time, Hamilton was amongst the first on track with the medium tyres bolted on, the Ferrari driver seemingly doing a shake down of his car following his crash out of Free Practice 3 a few hours prior.\nWith others joining the action a few minutes in – the majority running the soft compound, the exception being Hamilton’s team mate Leclerc on the mediums – it was Russell who had gone fastest following the opening runs via an effort of 1m 23.247s.\nThe margins were incredibly fine, however, with Bearman only 0.007s behind in second while Piastri was a further one thousandth of a second adrift of the Haas. Verstappen placed in fourth, ahead of Hamilton, Alonso and championship leader Norris.\nAt the other end of the timesheets, Ocon, Albon, Leclerc, Gasly and Colapinto – the latter yet to get a lap on the board after having both of his times deleted for exceeding track limits – were the names at risk in the elimination zone. Gasly and Stroll had also fallen victim to track limits, with each also seeing one of their laps erased.\nFollowing a brief lull, the pack prepared to return to the track for their last runs as the session entered its final minutes. Title contenders Norris, Verstappen and Piastri were all sporting fresh soft tyres – and this seemed to pay off for the latter, who went quickest on a 1m 22.605s.\nThis put the Australian two-tenths clear of Verstappen, while Norris was just over half a second away in sixth place, with Antonelli, Alonso and Leclerc ahead of him. Meanwhile others were trying to guarantee their spot in Q2, with Gasly improving before being pushed back down the order by Stroll.\nAlso finding themselves in the danger zone were Albon, Hulkenberg and Colapinto – and while Hamilton initially looked to have avoided the bottom five, improvements from others saw the Briton end up in 16th place, resulting in another Q1 exit.\nKnocked out: Hamilton, Albon, Hulkenberg, Gasly, Colapinto\nQ2 – Russell sets the pace, Antonelli drops out\nAs the dust settled on Q1, 15 minutes went on the clock to kickstart Q2 at the Yas Marina Circuit. Verstappen was the first to head out, the Dutchman enjoying a quiet track as he set a banker lap on used soft tyres.\nOthers soon started to join the fray – and when everybody had set a time, Russell was again the man on top thanks to his lap of 1m 22.730s, giving him an advantage of 0.022s over second-placed Verstappen, while Norris was only 0.074s behind Russell in third.\nPiastri and Alonso followed in fourth and fifth respectively, but those less at ease in the danger zone were Hadjar, Tsunoda, Antonelli, Bearman and Lawson. A queue had formed in the pit lane as the field readied themselves for their final runs – yet Verstappen was not amongst them, Red Bull seemingly feeling safe enough to stay in the garage.\nWhile Bortoleto surged up to an eye-catching fourth, fellow rookie Antonelli could not do enough to avoid elimination, the Mercedes driver being pushed down to P14. Hadjar climbed up into the top 10, which then knocked out team mate Lawson.\nThere were also contrasting fortunes at Haas, with Ocon moving into ninth just as Bearman missed the cut in 11th. Tsunoda made it through in 10th, but it was not such a good day for Sainz and Stroll, both exiting in 12th and 15th respectively.\nKnocked out: Bearman, Sainz, Lawson, Antonelli, Stroll\nQ3 – Verstappen outpaces Norris and Piastri for pole\nTsunoda was the first to emerge as the top-10 shootout began, but it was the other Red Bull of Verstappen that topped the timesheets once the first runs had been completed, the World Champion going quickest on an impressive 1m 22.295s.\nIn his final weekend racing for the squad, Tsunoda played a team role by giving Verstappen a tow, with the Dutchman subsequently beating closest challenger Piastri by 0.327s. Norris was four-and-a-half tenths back in third, followed by Leclerc and Russell.\nAhead of the decisive closing runs, Russell asked his team if they could get him behind Verstappen to get a tow of his own. McLaren, meanwhile, would be looking for a way to beat the four-time World Champion.\nAs the all-important last Qualifying laps of 2025 came in, Verstappen went even quicker on a 1m 22.207s. Piastri closed the gap down, but at 0.230s adrift it was not enough to beat the Dutch driver – and while Norris could not clinch pole either, the Briton outpaced his team mate to slot into second, 0.201 adrift of Verstappen.\nThis put Piastri in third, with Russell the nearest to the title contenders in fourth. Leclerc ended a tough recent run for Ferrari with P5, while a slightly mixed-up top 10 was rounded out by Alonso, Bortoleto, Ocon, Hadjar and Tsunoda.\nKey quote\n\"In Q2 I stayed on scrubbed tyres, and I think those laps already felt quite decent,\" said Verstappen. \"Of course then in Q3, around here track temp is coming down, you know that you can push a bit more, and that’s exactly what we did. We found a bit more lap time and of course I’m incredibly happy to be in first. That’s the only thing that we can do, right? That’s the only thing that we can control. I try to just maximise everything we have, what we have with the car, and we definitely did that in Qualifying.\"\nWhat's next\nThe 2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is set to begin at 1700 local time on Sunday.

I mean, I have no regrets about my season.\n“I think the performance has been strong. I've hated this car at times, but I've also loved it at times. And I always tried to extract the most from it, even in the difficult weekends that we’ve had.\n“It's been, like I said before, a proper rollercoaster with the car.

", "published_time": "2025-12-01T14:57:38.268Z", "url": "https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/verstappen-did-not-put-a-foot-wrong-says-mekies-as-he-hails-extraordinary.2w0em7AjOh6ig5IRtoMbKt", "content": "Red Bull Team Principal Laurent Mekies reflects on the Qatar Grand Prix.\nLaurent Mekies was swift to pay tribute to both Red Bull and Max Verstappen in the wake of the Dutchman’s victory in the Qatar Grand Prix, which was achieved despite the RB21 not being a match for the McLaren on pace across the weekend as a whole.\nVerstappen’s win was teed up by the decision to pit under the early Lap 7 Safety Car, with the Dutchman the first to pull into the pit lane, with both McLaren cars staying out. That enabled Verstappen to jump ahead of his rivals once Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris did pit, and he held on to win the race by a comfortable margin.\nHis victory also ensured he leapfrogged Piastri into second in the Drivers’ Championship and is now just 12 points behind Norris, meaning there will be a three-way fight for the title next weekend in the final race of the season.\n“We can definitely be happy with that one,\" Mekies said after the race. \"The pace in the car steadily improved from Friday night when we were in a tricky position, to tonight when we could fight with the McLarens, which is a testament to the team once again.\n“Of course, the decisive moment was the call to come in under the Safety Car and it was another great call from our strategy team here and those working back in Milton Keynes. From there on, Max didn't put a foot wrong, drove two incredible stints, taking great care of his tyres and managed to create a solid gap to the McLarens, which drove us to this most welcome race win.”\nMekies admitted he and his team were “surprised” that McLaren did not pit at least one car under the Safety Car. With the Qatar race being 57 laps long and the tyres only allowed to complete a maximum of 25 laps thanks to a mandate from Pirelli , the Safety Car coming out when it did enabled most of the field to file in for a ‘cheap’ pit stop.\n“We were very surprised because on our side we had sort of pre-decided that that would be the first lap we can take it and [that] we would take it,\" he added. \"But I cannot judge for what was their thought process at that moment. But yes, we were very surprised, yes.\"\nBut what made Mekies the happiest was the fact that Red Bull turned a difficult car that was off the pace of the McLaren into one that was competitive for the Grand Prix. That was no mean feat considering that Qatar’s track layout played to all their rival’s strengths.\n“We are behind from Friday by a large amount, four or five tenths, which was painful,\" Mekies explained. \"Then everyone has done an amazing job back at base and here at the racetrack to continue to try to put the car in different windows to see if we could close that gap. We were expecting McLaren to be strong in that circuit.\n“It's a long mid-speed corner on which they have been killing us on quite a few tracks. I remember Zandvoort, I remember Budapest. It's really the tracks where they know they have an advantage.\n“Now, the gap reduced to somewhat the two tenths of Qualifying, two and a half tenths of Qualifying… but I think we were closer than that in the race. I don't know if we are just matching, or only half a tenth slower, or maybe half a tenth faster, but we are certainly not two and a half tenths slower per lap, so I think we are very close in the race.”\nKeeping close to McLaren enabled Verstappen’s strategy to play out, as it meant McLaren could never build enough of an advantage to pit and come back out in front – despite running in free air.\nAnd Mekies laid the credit for the victory equally at the door of both the team and his four-time World Champion, who remains in the hunt for a fifth title.\n“I will just tell you this team had never given up, kept trying, kept developing, and cracked one thing, cracked a bit more, cracked a bit more, and eventually got the car in a better place,\" he said. \"As you can see, weekend in, weekend out, it's still incredibly difficult, and that's it.\n“[Verstappen] never gets it wrong, he never misses a start, he never misses a Turn 1, he's going to extract more out of the tyres than most people out there…\n“The team has been extraordinary at strong executions, so it is true we have benefited from our competitors' less strong executions, but please allow me to give credit to the incredible string of massively strong races, massively strong executions from the team [who] never got a call wrong.”\nVerstappen goes into the season finale in Abu Dhabi 12 points behind Norris and four ahead of Piastri. His fate is not in his own hands – even if he wins the race he is not guaranteed the title. But he is in with a shout, which when he trailed by over 100 points earlier in the season, never seemed possible."}

I was fairly happy with the car, we just need to be probably a little bit faster!\n“I think still not quick enough, but I think overall we’ve been in – for us – a decent window around here.”\nVerstappen and Red Bull have battled severe bouncing and ride issues with the RB21, and the Dutchman admitted that this area of the car was still far from ideal through FP1 and FP2 at the Yas Marina Circuit.\n“That’s a constant fight that we have, but that’s nothing new,” he said, before pondering whether his engineers can get the car into a better window – and in turn find more pace – for Saturday’s running.\n“It seems like it’s a decent gap that we need to close, but from our side we’ll just try to put the best car forward,” Verstappen commented. “Let’s see how much we can find overnight.”\nPressed on whether time needs to be found across both short and long runs, or if he thinks he will be in the fight over one lap, he replied: “No, no.

Let’s see what we can do.\n“Of course, I will try to win the race, but also in the back of my mind we want to try and score a lot of points to still try and win that championship.

And at one point, it doesn’t matter how successful you are, it will break it up. It will create problems eventually.\n“You can deal with it one year, quite intense, maybe two years, but it’s not sustainable for me personally. If you’re not fighting for championships, it’s less of a problem. There’s not really high stakes.\n“At the end of the day, you really see the true colours of people when you fight for championships, but it’s very tough and if I would be a team boss I would never do that, risk two drivers fighting like that.”\nWhen asked what his dream line-up would be if he could select from any driver in the sport’s history, Verstappen responded: “It might sound a bit controversial, but if you would have to have them drive the current car, they would struggle.\n“In sport, people evolve, sports evolve, become more professional, and that’s why I think it’s always very important to just leave the greats in their era because they were the best in their era with what they knew, what the world knew, and that’s why I find it very unfair when people ask me this.\n“First of all, who do you think is the greatest? For me it’s impossible to answer because every generation or era had their own greatest driver.”\nDespite this, Verstappen conceded that there are certain moments in the past that he would like to have the opportunity to observe more closely.\n“You can ask the question of who would you like to see, if it would be interesting to see how they would be working at their prime,” the Dutch racer said. “For example, I think it would be quite cool to see Michael [Schumacher] in his Ferrari days, be in there and observe how he was with everyone, and is there something to learn.\n“Stuff like that for me, and at the same time you could argue, would you want to be in the [ McLaren ] team when Ayrton [Senna] was fighting with [Alain] Prost ? Probably not, but at the same time they were winning and dominating as a team, so you learn, and I think it’s just very interesting to be a part of.”"}

I was already prepared for these kind of outcomes, because we needed a bit of luck to win.\n“From our side, at least we optimised the weekend perfectly – we put it on pole, we won the race in I think dominant fashion, so there is nothing really that you can say about that.\n“At the end of course, then you lose the championship by two points [and it] looks painful, but on the other hand, if you look from where we were in Zandvoort, more than 100 behind, then I think it’s not too bad.”\nPushed on how much pride he feels about his and Red Bull’s comeback, given their situation over the summer, the Dutchman added: “I’m very proud of the whole team. We could have also very easily given up at that point, when you’re that far behind.\n“I don’t think that’s how this team works. We always try to look for improvements and understand our issues, and that’s definitely what we did. The turnaround has been fun, and today has been fun.\n“We didn’t win the championship, okay, that happens, that’s life, and it’s not something that I’ll be too sad about. I mean, life goes on.\n“I’m just very proud of the people I work with, they are my second family, and we will enjoy this moment. We will enjoy the second half of the season, be proud of that, and next year is going to be a big question mark for everyone anyway.”"}

Pretty straightforward stuff before arriving here.”\nVerstappen went on to detail how he is seemingly not feeling the pressure entering into the weekend, having not anticipated that he would still be in the championship fight given that he was 104 points adrift of former leader Oscar Piastri just a few months ago in August.\n“I’m very relaxed, nothing to lose,” the 28-year-old reflected. “I’m just enjoying being here, but for me it’s not even about being here – I’ve been enjoying the second half of the season, working with the team and how we’ve been able to turn things around from difficult times.\n“[We’ve gone from] having a debrief after the race, feeling very disappointed and frustrated with the performances, to just enjoying, smiling, having these wins again. It’s fantastic, so I’ll just take it.\n“To me everything here is just a bonus and sitting here fighting for the title. That’s also what makes it really straightforward for me. We will just try to have a good weekend, but even then it’s not really in my control, so I guess I’ll just try to enjoy it.”\nLooking back on the campaign, Verstappen struggled to pick out any particular incident that he would deem as one where the title might have gotten away from him.\n“At the end of the day, it’s won over 24 races – some races go a bit better than others,” the four-time World Champion conceded. “A lot of the races we didn’t have a lot of pace, or enough pace to challenge for a win, but here we are.\n“In general I’m just very proud of the season we’ve done, how we’ve come back as well in the second half. We’ll just try and keep it fun now until the end, but to always pick one particular moment or whatever, that’s always a hard one.”"}

Lance Stroll (Aston Martin) and Hadjar eventually recorded DNFs at the end.\nOllie Bearman retired after serving a 10-second stop/go penalty over his car being in an unsafe condition, while Hulkenberg's race ended in the gravel after his collision with Gasly.\nAS IT HAPPENED\nAs the lights went out Norris from P2 suffered the slightly worse start amongst the title challengers, allowing Verstappen to move ahead before the long-right of Turn 1 and slot in behind Piastri, who comfortably held the lead from pole.\nThe Australian had already broken DRS range by the end of the opening lap and put his head down as the gaps between the leading runners began to expand almost immediately, with following proving extremely difficult through the high-speed corners.\nFurther back, Russell dropped three places after running slightly wide through Turn 2, as team mate Antonelli, Sainz and Alonso all moved ahead of the Mercedes driver through the opening corners.\nGasly in P9 also ran slightly wide, damaging the underside of his car over the kerb and gravel, and was put under pressure by Hulkenberg, who along with Hamilton were the only drivers to start on Pirelli's soft tyre.\nThe German had passed Leclerc into Turn 1 in the opening laps and tried the outside line with Gasly shortly after, but the Sauber driver was left in the gravel on the exit with his right-rear tyre hanging off.\nThe left-front of the Alpine had made contact with the Sauber, the stewards investigating but taking no further action as Gasly resumed.\nThe incident brought out the Safety Car just inside the window which would allow drivers to run the remaining 50 laps with just the need for one more pit stop, with a 25-lap limit imposed for all sets of tyres by Pirelli.\nCritically, the McLarens of Piastri and Norris stayed out, meaning Verstappen rejoined back in P3 on another set of medium tyres but with effectively one less pit stop to take compared with the two leaders.\nOcon had also initially stayed out but was handed a five-second penalty for a false start and entered the pit lane after the majority of the field and rejoined at the back.\nRacing resumed on Lap 11, Piastri leading from Norris and Verstappen, with Sainz having jumped Antonelli in the pits, as Alonso, Hadjar, Russell, Leclerc and Bearman completed the top-10.\nThe McLarens began to lap more than 1s a lap faster than the rest of the field, all of whom would be required to stop on Lap 32 to make the end on a two-stop strategy.\nIn turn, the McLarens needed to stop no later than Lap 25, Piastri pitting on lap 24 with a 4s lead over Norris and crucially rejoining in clean air having emerged in front of a large group headed by Alonso in P6.\nNorris rejoined even closer to Alonso the next lap, but a 2.2s pit stop proved pivotal as Verstappen now led Sainz, Antonelli, Piastri and Norris.\nPiastri soon caught the back of Antonelli and immediately dived up the inside at Turn 1 on the start of Lap 30, but Norris was unable to pass Antonelli at the same spot two laps later.\nThe McLarens found themselves back at the front as the the majority of the field made the pit lane a hive of activity on Lap 32, with Verstappen rejoining in P3 on the hard tyre but only 7.6 behind Piastri.\nNorris ran wide at the high-speed right of Turn 14, running over the kerb and nearly spinning, asking his team over the radio to check for damage as he began to fall into the clutches of Verstappen.\nPiastri also had a moment at the same corner as he attempted to build up his margin, with Verstappen starting to get into the dirty air of Norris nearly 8s behind.\nPiastri pitted at the end of Lap 42 for a new set of hard tyres, rejoining P3 but now 17s behind Verstappen, who was within 1s of Norris before the Briton also pitted for the hard tyre on Lap 44.\nRejoining behind both Sainz and Antonelli, Norris soon closed on the pair but was unable to shape for a pass until Antonelli suffered a moment of oversteer on the exit of Turn 10 on the penultimate lap which allowed him ahead.\nWith Verstappen's seventh Grand Prix win of the season, by a margin of eight seconds, it means the Dutchman sits just 12 points behind Norris, with Piastri a further four points back ahead of the final race in Abu Dhabi.\nSainz claimed his second podium of the season from Norris, while Antonelli finished well clear of Russell, who had benefitted from a late puncture for Hadjar to finish P6.\nThe top-10 was completed by Alonso, who finished despite a huge 360-degree spin which dropped him behind Hadjar and Russell, as Leclerc, Lawson and Tsunoda all scored points.\nThe rest of the order was completed by Albon, Hamilton, Bortoleto, Colapinto, Ocon and Gasly, with Stroll, Hadjar, Bearman and Hulkenberg recorded as retirees.\nKey quote\n\"This was an incredible race for us,\" said Verstappen. \"We made the right call as a team to box under the Safety Car. That was smart. Of course, I’m super happy to win here and stay in the fight until the end. Incredible.\n\"I think [the pace] was a little bit offset because of it all, but for us I think it was a very strong race on a weekend where it was a little bit tough. We still won the race and that was the most important thing.\"\nWhat's next\nF1 will travel straight to Abu Dhabi for the final race of the season from December 5-7 where the 2025 Drivers' title will be decided.

The Spaniard came home third for his second rostrum of the season – third if you include Sprint results – to make sure that Williams finish on top of the midfield.\nWilliams finished ninth last season, with 17 points to show for their campaign. That turnaround to finish fifth this year , with 137 points and counting, means the team sit 45 points ahead of their nearest rivals with one round remaining.\n“It is mathematically finished now. This surpasses our expectations really and I hope it shows the world the direction we are on and the belief we have in where we are going as a result of things,” team boss James Vowles said in the wake of the Qatar Grand Prix.\n“We are still here to win championships. We are a long way away from that, a long way away. But at least now the work we are doing is starting to pay off.”\nSainz made a great start in Qatar, before managing to pick up a further place in the first round of pit stops.\nHis podium charge was aided by McLaren’s strategy calls – with the team opting not to pit either car under the Safety Car – but nonetheless, the Spaniard had put in quick lap after quick lap to maintain enough of an advantage that Lando Norris could not reel him in late on.\nSainz duly claimed P3 for the second time in a Grand Prix this year, despite a late scare when his can began to understeer.\n“We lost about eight degrees of tyre temperature on the front right, and a little bit of downforce all in one go which suggests a small component failed,” Vowles explained. “But basically, the right-hand corners he was suffering in, he did brilliantly with it. He calmly brought the car to the end of the race, so good job.\n“Exceptional. Really fantastic performance from Carlos and the team when it counted and every detail adds up. Getting on the podium by milliseconds really is such a just reward for the incredible work the whole team is putting in this year.\n“I was proud of Carlos and the team when we got our first podium in Baku; the second is a dream come true, but perhaps more importantly at a track that was almost our worst last year. And we've come back, we've reinvented ourselves and the result is there for everyone to see.”\nBefore the weekend began, both Williams drivers were quick to temper expectations here, saying the track characteristics did not suit their car. As such, getting both cars into the top 10 in Sprint Qualifying, and Sainz backing that up with a Q3 in Qualifying, showed just how far the team have come.\nThe Spaniard scored in the Sprint and the Grand Prix, with back-to-back top five finishes after coming home P5 in Las Vegas. Alex Albon did not manage to score in Qatar, but his consistency at the start of the season was a big factor in Williams finishing where they have done.\n“For Alex, we will come back fighting in Abu Dhabi. We haven't got it all together this weekend, but I'll reiterate that his performance across the season is why we've secured fifth in the Constructors' Championship today. And more so than that, his pace is still there. We just need to bring it all together,” Vowles concluded."}

They claimed fewer points on just one other occasion this season – their double DNF at Zandvoort.\nThe Monegasque driver admitted that there is “zero performance” in the car as he struggled with excessive oversteer throughout the weekend, culminating in a massive spin in Q3 that led to him starting the race in 10th place.\nOn the other side of the garage, things were just as bleak for Lewis Hamilton , with the former champion qualifying P18 for both the Sprint and Grand Prix. He ultimately took the chequered flag nearly 16 seconds behind Yuki Tsunoda , the last of the scorers at a circuit that has few overtaking opportunities.\nVasseur previously confirmed that Ferrari chose to switch focus to their 2026 challenger back in April, halting development on this season’s car, but he insisted that the problem in Qatar was more linked to their set-up than a lack of upgrades.\n“I think this weekend we struggled a lot with the set-up and prescription of the tyre pressure,” he said. “We struggled from Lap 1 to the last lap of the race. It was probably a bit better today but only marginally. It’s part of the expedition, part of this weekend that due to the set-up, we were in a tough situation from Lap 1.\n“I can’t say that it was all positive but the collaboration and debrief was positive and we were all pushing in the same direction. I understand [the drivers'] frustration in the TV pen, but the most important thing is when they’re back in the garage with the mechanics and engineers trying to find a solution. We tried this weekend but I think we had the issue – it’s not a secret – with the power steering at the beginning of the weekend.\n“Then you go into Qualifying and the Sprint, and you can’t change between the two. We made big changes and I think it was okay-ish today but we went too far. The others are all fine-tuning but if you start miles away… I think it was in Q1 or Q2 yesterday you had two-tenths between P5 and P16. If you're out of the window, for sure you’ll lose a tonne of positions and on a track like this where you have zero deg [tyre degradation], it’s not easy to overtake. On top of that, you impose the two-stop.”\nVasseur also admitted that the Safety Car appearance on Lap 7 was Ferrari’s “worst case scenario” discussed before the race – it prompted nine out of 10 teams to head into the pits, forcing them to use the full allocation of 25 laps on their remaining tyres.\nWith most of the field pitting on the same laps, Hamilton lost out due to the double stack and high volume of traffic in the pit lane, but the strategy wasn’t the only struggle for the Scuderia. They were also significantly off the pace compared to McLaren, Red Bull and Mercedes, but Vasseur appeared confident that it wasn’t a sign of wider issues despite the team finishing P4 in the Teams' Standings – their worst result since 2020.\n“We as a team have to stay in our bubble and try to get the best from what we have,” he said. “You have to deal with this kind of situation – Max [Verstappen] was able to do it. He was P8 in Qualifying in Budapest, was P9 in the race and then he started to win races.\n“You can come back, and as a team we have to understand what we did wrong this weekend. From my understanding so far, it related to the tyre pressure prescription that we struggled to deal with, but it’s the same for everybody. We did a worse job than the others.\n“Charles said he pushed like hell from Lap 1 on Friday morning to the last lap of the race, and I think he was probably pushing more than on some weekends where he won races. I understand the frustration that you’re pushing like hell to finish P8 or P9.”"}

There is no doubt that in terms of starting point – so where he started in January – the starting point was outstanding.\n“Then we are strong believers not only in the raw talent, but also the ability of the drivers to develop. We have seen so many champions developing through the years, doing things that they had not done in the car a few races before.\n“We've seen that with Isack this year too. We’ve seen him making stuff in the car that he was not doing three races before.”\nIn terms of what his expectations are for Hadjar next season, the Red Bull Team Principal continued: “To answer your question, we expect – we would like him to continue onto that path. We don't see it as a landing point.\n“We see it as another start for him to continue to develop, to continue to impress us, to continue to surprise us. And you will expect that in the second year. You will expect that in the third year, perhaps in the fourth year. So that's a little bit the journey for us together.”"}

After displacing the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso , who was passed by both Red Bull cars, Yuki Tsunoda let his team mate through to chase down the top three.\nDespite his best efforts, Verstappen was unable to keep up with his rivals ahead as he reported that the car was jumping up and down, forcing him to manage the issue and prevent it getting worse before the all-important Qualifying hour at 1800 local time.\n“The start was good,” he said after the Sprint. “I think the first two corners worked out well, and then we just fell into the same problems as yesterday. Of course we know that you can’t change the car, but at least it’s good to know in the sense that in Qualifying and race pace you’re facing the same problems.\n“We have a few things that we need to work on now to try and improve because you don’t want any kind of bouncing or jumping on a track like this. That’s what we’ll try to work on, plus trying to look after our front tyres a little bit better.”\nSpeaking to Sky Sports F1 , he added: “It’s been difficult so far. I think the first three laps I just pushed a bit more compared to the guys ahead to try and have an opportunity, knowing that passing was tough. After that, you just get into the same trouble.\n“Of course, the more the tyres wear, the more you feel those kinds of issues. That basically then prevented us from following them. I was basically just doing my own race out there. We need to work on that and try to get rid of the bouncing, jumping, understeer in general in the long corners – that’s still a big problem.”\nTsunoda quickly dropped back from his team mate after allowing him to pass, with his biggest challenge of the Sprint proving to be staying within track limits as he was hit with a five-second time penalty.\nThat initially demoted him to P6 behind Kimi Antonelli , but the Mercedes driver committed the same offence and was handed the same punishment once the Sprint was over, lifting Tsunoda back to P5.\n“Fortunately, the driver I was fighting with also got track limits,” Tsunoda said after scoring his first points since the United States Grand Prix. “To be honest, I had track limits four times. Maybe two times, I can understand it, but the extra two I have to review why. At least now I’m aware going into Qualifying so I can make sure I’m careful at those corners.\n“It’s been a good race weekend so far, it’s been smooth. I knew it was a matter of putting it all together for the weekend. The important things are coming up but I’ll just do the same and put it all together more.”"}

We were very strong there last year.\"\nWhen asked whether McLaren could have split its strategy, especially after Verstappen entered the pit lane ahead of Norris, Brown replied: \"No, we didn't want to change what we decided to do coming into the race. I think it's always dangerous to maybe second guess yourself.\"\nThe result means Norris holds a 12-point lead over Verstappen heading to the final race of the season next weekend at the Yas Marina Circuit, with Piastri a further four points behind.\nThe result in Qatar comes after both McLaren drivers were disqualified at the previous round in Las Vegas, with Team Principal Andrea Stella admitting the team, and not the drivers, needed to do a better job.\n\"We are disappointed because we are haemorrhaging points in a way in the last two events,\" he told F1 TV .\n\"Our drivers are doing a very good job and, if anything, it's the team that needs to elevate their game and make sure that we give our drivers the possibility to capitalise on their great driving.\n\"On the other side, we need to just look forward, get all the learning that we receive from racing but at the same time we need to think forward, prepare, remain confident.\n\"We have a fast car, we have two great drivers, we need to use all the information to make sure that we execute a perfect race weekend.

George Russell , Pierre Gasly , Charles Leclerc and Lance Stroll are among those who’ve been hopping on the skis over the festive period, with time in the mountains proving to be a driver’s favourite for mixing training up – whilst getting their high-speed fix.\nQuality family time\nA gruelling F1 season is tough on the drivers for many reasons, but time spent away from family might be the hardest for the grid to deal with – so it’s no surprise that the winter break is all about quality time at home. For Russell and Liam Lawson , uncle duties called, as the pair enjoyed hanging out with their nieces in the festive period.\nAntonelli and Bortoleto wished us some happy holidays with posts of their family under their Christmas trees, while Stroll gave us a look at his Canadian break, featuring table tennis, snow, and more adorable family time – a nice change of pace for the paddock.\nHolidays and adventures\nDrivers get to travel the world as they make their way through the F1 calendar, but for some the travelling doesn’t stop during the break. The grid love an adventure, and if Leclerc’s Antarctica trip hadn’t been cancelled, they would have visited every continent between them.\nFerrari ’s Lewis Hamilton chose to give the Big Apple a visit, his “favourite city”, and even spent some time with Hollywood actor Michael B. Jordan. Bortoleto found some time during his vacation to get in the gym in his native Brazil, while new Racing Bulls driver Arvid Lindblad flew to Mumbai in India.\nThai driver Alex Albon relaxed in the country whom he races for, before exploring the stunning and remote Bhutan. Ocon got his fix of Marvel, spending Christmas in Disneyland Paris with partner Flavy Barla, while Mercedes ’ Russell combined the cold mountain weather with some warm desert sun during his Kenyan safari – an impressive array of destinations all round.\nAt the awards\nWinter also brings a chance to celebrate the highs of the year just gone. Newly crowned World Champion Lando Norris marked his triumph at the FIA Prize Giving in Uzbekistan, with the Brit sharing some behind-the-scenes glimpses of the evening on his socials for what he called “the night I’d waited for my whole life.”\nElsewhere, Gasly put the spotlight on giving back, attending the Make-A-Wish France gala, having spent the year as an ambassador for the charity. One of his helmets was auctioned for charity – a lovely way for the Frenchman to use his platform to help children in care.\nItching for the comeback\nWe reckon few drivers are counting down the hours to lights out in Melbourne quite like Bottas and Sergio Perez will be. After a year away from the grid, both are set to make their highly anticipated returns in 2026 with the brand-new Cadillac team – and they’re making sure to leave no stone unturned in their preparations.\nWhile Bottas and Perez have clearly made the most of their “sabbaticals”, they’ve recently been sharing glimpses of the hard work going into what it takes to get race-ready again on their socials. Not long to wait guys!\nA time for reflection\nIn classic December fashion, drivers have spent some time reminiscing over a life-changing past year, especially the 2025 rookies. Isack Hadjar and Ollie Bearman posted end-of-year recaps after their milestone years, and with such impressive maiden campaigns, we can’t wait to see what they will achieve in their sophomore seasons!"}

He watched his deputy have a decent session, keeping things tidy on both the medium and soft tyres. But more important was watching Norris go fast – the McLaren clearly has speed to burn here, as the Championship leader topped the session. Norris was even quicker in the second session, topping the standings by a healthy margin to get his weekend off to the dream start. But Piastri struggled, making a mistake on both his flying laps on the soft tyre. As such, he was left without a representative time on the C5 rubber, which is far from ideal on such a crucial weekend.\nLando Norris - FP1: 1:24.485, P1; FP2: 1:23.083, P1\n\"A decent first day in Abu Dhabi, although there's still a little bit more to find in the car. I'm not completely happy with it just yet, but overall, it's been a positive day. Nothing to smile about just yet, as we know it gets closer as the weekend goes on, but a good starting point.\"\nOscar Piastri - FP2: 1:23.763, P11\n“A shorter day for me today, but lots of learning in FP2. The car was in a good window, we just need to make a few tweaks overnight. I was finding my feet towards the end, so we’ll review overnight and head into Quali day in a strong position.”\nPato O’Ward - FP1: 1:25.246, P14\n\"It was exciting to be back in the car and help the team put our best foot forward, going into what is probably the most important Sunday of the year for the team with Lando and Oscar competing for the Championship. We completed the run plan well, helping Oscar set up the car. Thanks to the team for the opportunity this afternoon, I’m excited to get back in the car on Tuesday for the test.”\nAndrea Stella, Team Principal\n“A reasonable start to the final weekend of the season, completing the plan across both Free Practice sessions as we intended.\n“Oscar was back at the wheel for FP2 and was able to find his references in terms of single lap performance, high fuel running and the tyre behaviour. I’m sure he will be completely ready going into tomorrow when the sessions become competitive.\n“Lando was a bit more comfortable in the second session, but as always, Abu Dhabi, the last race of the year, shows that the field is extremely tight. Therefore, we appreciate the competition and need to make sure that we continue to work hard to execute a perfect weekend.\n“Well done to Pato for his second session in the MCL39, completing our fourth mandatory young driver appearance of the season. He drove very well, delivering all the information that we required to get the initial readings of the car.”\n1 / 3\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 05: Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL39 Mercedes on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 05, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty Images)\nRed Bull\nVerstappen pushed Norris very, very close in FP1, winding up just 0.008s back. But the Dutchman was not fully happy with his opening session, complaining that something felt broken on the car. As for Lindblad, he had a steady hour in Tsunoda’s car – even if he did say it felt like driving on ice out there. As the sun set, Verstappen found conditions more to his liking and once again finished behind Norris – albeit a little further back. He is in a really good position heading into the weekend, while Tsunoda needs to find some pace if he wants to make Q3 and help his team mate out tomorrow.\nMax Verstappen - FP1: 1:24.493, P2; FP2: 1:23.446, P2\n“It went pretty okay in our practice sessions. I was fairly happy with the car today, we just probably needed to be a little bit faster. We were in a decent window, but I think still think not quite quick enough. It seems like there is a decent gap that we need to close but we still need to work on the race pace, so let’s see how much we can find overnight. The ride has been tricky and the single laps and long runs need to be a bit better, but let’s see what we can do tomorrow.\"\nYuki Tsunoda - FP2: 1:24.303, P17\n“I didn’t expect it to be this challenging to be honest, we are still very far away with the car and I don’t know exactly what is going on. We need to really look into things overnight because today felt like one of the worst practice sessions of the season. The car doesn’t feel very comfortable right now, I keep sliding around and we have to find out why and what is causing this issue. It’s not great right now, I hope we can get into a better place overnight to be able to perform tomorrow.\"\nArvid Lindblad - FP1: 1:25.256, P15\n\"I'd like to start off saying a huge thank you to Oracle Red Bull Racing for the opportunity once again in the car. It's always an amazing opportunity and a real pleasure to drive in Formula One, so I'm grateful for it. On the session itself, I'm not super happy with the way it went from my side. I felt that I could've done a better job and I'll go away from today with a few things to work on ahead of next year. Driving in both F1 and F2 this weekend has been something new for me, so there was a bit of a balancing act that came with it. Nevertheless, I hope that I got some good data for the Team that they can use for the rest of the weekend.\"\nGianpiero Lambiase, Head of Racing\n“With Arvid, we used his time in FP1 to collect some data on a few set up parameters that we weren’t 100% convinced of in simulation. That was really useful and he provided some very consistent data to analyse and his feedback was generally aligned to what we were expecting. It was generally a productive day with Max: we focused a little bit less on single lap performance for high fuel sustainable running, which now gives us a bit more data heading into Sunday. I think that has been proven useful as the tyres were a little bit more vulnerable compared to what we were perhaps expecting. It looks like front right graining is a problem for the field, so we need to analyse how we improve the longevity of this tyre heading into Sunday. Degradation is a bit higher than expected, so whilst we thought it would have been a relatively straight forward one stop, there’s a question mark over that now. We really need to understand how many stops it is going to be and how we will look after our tyres. The mood in the Team is really good, it has been business as usual for us since we arrived and that is how we’ve approached the last nine or ten races since the shutdown. We’ll continue to do our thing and follow our process and the end result will look after itself. Max is doing well in the car and we will not give up until the chequered flag is waved.\"\n1 / 3\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 05: Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing prepares to drive during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 05, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Mark Thompson/Getty Images)\nMercedes\nMercedes were able to field both their main drivers in FP1, with both looking fast to boot. The Silver Arrows certainly seem in the mix here, with Antonelli just shading Russell in the first session. Once the sun set, Russell found even more pace and radioed to say how good the car felt in the evening conditions. He wound up third and, interestingly, just 0.016s behind Verstappen on a day where tight margins between the top four teams were very evident. Antonelli finished in the top 10 as well, so Mercedes can be pleased with their opening day.\nGeorge Russell - FP1: 1:24.733, P6; FP2: 1:23.462, P3\n\"We didn’t start off the day in the best place in FP1, but we were able to improve the car for FP2. In the hot conditions of the day, the car doesn’t always feel at its nicest, but it improves once the sun goes down and the track cools a little. That certainly helped along with the changes we made between the sessions.\n\"It looks like it will be tight between the usual suspects at the front in qualifying tomorrow, but there could be some surprises in the mix including the Haas of Ollie Bearman and both Saubers who were quick today. We will have to execute well if we are to secure a good grid position. Equally, we’ve got work to do on our race pace; we will review tonight how we can improve that, and we will see where that leaves us on Sunday.\"\nKimi Antonelli - FP1: 1:24.608, P4; FP2: 1:23.750, P10\n\"I don’t think we quite showed our full potential today. We made improvements heading into FP2, but I made a small mistake on my best Soft tyre effort near the end of the lap and that left me P10. We’re definitely there in the mix near the front for qualifying, although the McLaren certainly looks like the car to beat after today. The gaps are very tight across the field; we will need to perform at our best if we are to secure a good grid position.\n\"Our long run in FP2 was much better than FP1 but we will look to improve the car further overnight so we can look ahead to race day with plenty of confidence. I am feeling good in the car though, looking forward to the rest of the weekend and to helping the team secure P2 in the Constructors’.\"\nAndrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director\n\"George had already sat out both his FP1 sessions and Kimi is not required to do this given he is a rookie. That put us in the useful position of being one of only two teams with both race drivers in the car for the first hour of practice. This went reasonably smoothly with both getting to grips with the car. The single lap looked OK but there was more to find on the balance; overall though, the pace was about where we'd expect.\n\"Frustratingly, the long run was not good. The car was bouncing in the high-speed which was unsettling it. We therefore made some changes to improve both balance and bouncing going into the evening session. On the single lap, the car was still in a reasonable place but neither George nor Kimi put together a perfect effort. Whilst we took a step forward, the long run was still not where we wanted it to be. We were suffering from a bit too much graining and that's defining our pace. That should improve with more rubber being laid down but we'll also be looking at how we can change the car to improve this. Compared to recent Fridays, this has been more challenging so we'll be working hard overnight to try and find some solutions.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 05: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W16 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 05, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images)\nFerrari\nThe Leclerc brothers took to the track in FP1, leading to the amusing moment where the elder brother spun at Turn 5, and Arthur used that opportunity to poke fun at his big bro – accusing him of practicing his burn outs for the crowd. When they actually knuckled down, Leclerc was quick over one lap but not happy with his car on longer runs. He fell down the order in FP2, meaning there is work to do for Ferrari overnight to extract more pace from their set-up. Hamilton was not happy either, as he finished 14th in his only session of the day.\nCharles Leclerc - FP1: 1:24.501, P3; FP2: 1:23.658, P8\n\"FP1 was very special for me. Seeing my younger brother behind the wheel of a Formula 1 car with the Scuderia, and sharing the track with him for a practice session is something we dreamed of together since we were kids and it put a smile on my face.\n\"In terms of driving, it was a tricky Friday for us overall. We are missing something and are pushing to find where we can improve to be further ahead in tomorrow’s qualifying.\"\nLewis Hamilton - FP2: 1:23.939, P14\n\"It was great to see Arthur in the car this afternoon in FP1 and I was feeling good coming into FP2. The car proved challenging to drive and there is some work to do ahead of tomorrow to improve the feeling with the car. We’ll review the data tonight and work on the areas that can help us make a step forward for tomorrow’s sessions.\"\nArthur Leclerc - FP1: 1:25.360, P16\n\"I’m really happy with this FP1. It was a good session and we gathered important data for the team and the simulator group. Everything went well and the pace was strong. The Soft tyres were completely new to me, so I just tried to give it my best. Being on track together with my brother and the other Formula 1 drivers is always a great emotion. I want to thank the whole team for this opportunity.\"\n1 / 3\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 05: Charles Leclerc of Monaco driving the (16) Scuderia Ferrari SF-25 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 05, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Clive Rose/Getty Images)\nHaas\nHirakawa was arguably the most impressive rookie in FP1, winding up just four and a half tenths off Norris despite not running the soft tyre. As for Bearman , he suffered a suspected hydraulics leak midway through FP1 and, after being sent back out, he was then called back to the pits to end his session early with a sensor problem. But Bearman had a much better time of it in FP2, lapping in the fourth fastest car after describing it as “insane” and reiterating how happy he was with the VF-25. Ocon was further down the order, as he continues to struggle to extract the same pace over one lap as his team mate.\nEsteban Ocon –FP2: 1:23.958, P16\n“It doesn’t seem to be working today – I can’t get the car to do one single lap. We’re half a second off every lap we do, so there’s a lot to look through. We can’t get the car to be how I’d like it to be.”\nOliver Bearman - FP1: 1:24.759, P8; FP2: 1:23.501, P4\n“We had a good car underneath us in FP1, and I had a great feeling. On the first run I had a bit of understeer, but I could feel that the car wanted to go fast. In FP1, I didn’t get to do a lot of the session as we had a small issue, but I did one lap on the medium compound and we were really competitive, and that carried over to this afternoon. I think the key point is that it’s very tight out there, we were four-tenths away, but five-tenths can put you outside the top 10. It’s going to be important to optimize everything tomorrow.”\nRyō Hirakawa - FP1: 1:24.934, P11\n“That was my fourth FP1 session of the season and I’ve learned so much, so thank you to both MoneyGram Haas F1 Team and TOYOTA GAZOO Racing for the opportunity this year. I think it was a pretty decent session, and finally I got to drive around a track I’ve already tested on in a Formula 1 car. I was able to push from lap 1 knowing the layout, able to give comprehensive feedback, and follow a positive trend in lap time. We were the team that put mediums on for our fastest lap, so I think we’re really competitive. I think we have a lot to analyze now, but we’re looking good.”\nAyao Komatsu, Team Principal\n“Ryō was back in the car for FP1, and I think he did a very good job, especially on the low-fuel runs. In the previous couple of outings, he wasn’t very happy with the brakes, but today he was. It goes to show, when you get that element right, that’s the performance he can provide. Ollie’s been happy with the car from the get-go, and looking at his lap time, he’s very confident. We have some fine-tuning to do, but that’s a strong place to start from. Esteban missed FP1 but was back in the car for FP2, and he’s struggling with the brakes and with entry stability, so we need to find a better compromise for him.”\n1 / 3\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 05: Sparks fly behind Oliver Bearman of Great Britain driving the (87) Haas F1 VF-25 Ferrari on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 05, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Both drivers wound up in the top 10, with Hulkenberg looking fast on the soft tyres. That trend continued in FP2, Hulkenberg finishing right the way up the order, with Bortoleto hot on his heels. The Brazilian was also involved in one amusing radio exchange, when he was baulked by “the big Leclerc” in the second session – his Race Engineer finding a unique way to differentiate between the two Leclerc brothers.\nNico Hulkenberg - FP1: 1:24.629, P5; FP2: 1:23.550, P5\n“It was a clean Friday for us, with no interruptions or problems on our side. It felt positive out there, and it’s nice to carry that good feeling into the weekend. Now, it’s about fine-tuning and dialling out the last little bits as we look to keep this momentum over the next 48 hours.”\nGabriel Bortoleto - FP1: 1:24.742, P7; FP2: 1:23.570, P6\n“Overall, today has been quite positive. There’s obviously still some fine-tuning to do ahead of tomorrow, but it was quite productive as we focused on understanding the balance in both high-fuel and low-fuel runs. It’s encouraging to see our car in those positions, even though it’s obviously still only Friday. We’ll keep pushing and aim to maximise our performance in qualifying tomorrow.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 05: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Kick Sauber C45 Ferrari makes a pitstop during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 05, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Peter Fox/Getty Images)\nRacing Bulls\nIwasa had a quiet session in Lawson’s car, leaving the majority of the work to Hadjar . The Frenchman looked quick early on before fading as the session wore on, and was left frustrated by traffic too. He improved in the second session, winding up in the top 10 despite once again getting a little frustrated by some of his colleagues. As for Lawson, he was a bit further down the order as he took his time getting adjusted to the track after sitting out FP1.\nIsack Hadjar - FP1: 1:24.977, P12; FP2: 1:23.657, P7\n“Overall, it was a good day here in Abu Dhabi. Honestly, I thought it would have been a bit better, as both Saubers and Ollie look really fast and ahead of us. We know we need to find some pace, and we’ll work on that overnight. We expect a real fight tomorrow in Qualifying.”\nLiam Lawson - FP2: 1:24.474, P18\n“FP2 was a little bit tricky as we missed FP1 this morning, so there's naturally a little bit of catching up to do. There's more work needed than we were expecting, so we'll get to it tonight and hopefully come back with a stronger car tomorrow. FP3 won't really be representative of Quali given how warm it will be, so the main thing will be focusing on learnings from today. Overall, as a team we're looking quite quick, so it's now a case of really fine tuning my car.\"\nMattia Spini, Chief Race Engineer\n“Abu Dhabi holds special significance with it being the final race of the season, but in terms of set up, there’s nothing that stands out as you need to be strong in all areas. We ran Ayumu in Liam's car for FP1, he had a clean session and collected valuable data for the team. Isack was not as satisfied with car balance on his fastest lap as he was on the Hard compound, we therefore used two sets of Soft tyres in FP2 to optimise Qualifying preparation as it’s the closest Free Practice session to Qualifying in terms of track conditions. He was more satisfied with car balance, he just requested improvements in a couple of corners. Liam used one set of Mediums and one set of Softs, like the majority of the field. He was not fully comfortable with the car in either short or long-run configuration, so we have work to do tonight to improve his pace. Again, we were able to cover good mileage on high fuel, gathering more data for Sunday's race.”\n1 / 3\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 05: Isack Hadjar of France and Visa Cash App Racing Bulls pprior to  during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 05, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Peter Fox/Getty Images)\nWilliams\nBrowning was in Albon’s car in FP1, but he soon experienced some radio static issues, after he failed to hear about an approaching Hadjar and slightly got in his rival’s way. The team brought him in to fix that radio, before sending him back out. It was not a straightforward session for Sainz either, who seemed to struggle with some braking problems. Roll on FP2, and this time it was Albon who struggled with some issues – complaining about his engine. As such, Williams have some work to do overnight to get on top of the gremlins so that both drivers can fight their way up the order tomorrow.\nAlex Albon - FP2: 1:23.950, P15\n\"Honestly, it's not been a bad day but there's little fires everywhere. I only did the one session today, but the car feels reasonably good. Degradation is much higher than we all expected so I think that will make Sunday interesting as before the event it was a clear one stop, and now it's not. There's a lot of grip out there but the front is sliding, and you can see everyone grabbing their front tyre. Tomorrow I just want to have a smooth FP3 and then we'll see how it goes, but I do know it's very tight; I reckon half a second is the difference in pretty much the whole field right now. So, it's all fun and exciting.\"\nCarlos Sainz - FP1: 1:24.771, P9; FP2: 1:23.872, P13\n\"It was an extremely tight session today. I think we’re in the fight, but it looks like Haas and Sauber are leading the midfield at the moment. We were quite surprised with the high degradation during the long runs, so it’s something for us to look at. For tomorrow, we’ll try to take a step forward and fight our way into Q3. It will come down to whoever can put the lap together, so maximum focus.\"\nLuke Browning - FP1: 1:25.490, P18\n\"Overall, a really positive FP1 session and great to get more mileage in an F1 car. It’s always an added challenge switching between F1 and F2 on the same day, but I’m enjoying being out there on track and learning how the current F1 car works. Now my focus is back on F2 as we close out this season, before getting my final opportunity to drive the FW47 this year at the post-season test!\"\n1 / 3\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 05: Carlos Sainz of Spain and Williams looks on in the garage during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 05, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Those two nearly had a coming together, with Shields trying to get off the racing line as Crawford approached at speed but not quite managing to do so. When Alonso and Stroll jumped back in for FP2 they kept their session clean and tidy, with the Spaniard just cracking the top 10 on a night where the gaps behind Norris were incredibly tight, with just three tenths of a second between Verstappen in P2 and Antonelli in P10.\nFernando Alonso - FP2: 1:23.708, P9\n\"With only one session today, we quickly had to learn how the car felt, and everything was as expected.\n\"The circuit is tricky to balance, but we will continue to work throughout the weekend and try to secure some points.\n\"It was also great to see Jak and Cian in the car this morning, learning while also gathering valuable data for the team.\"\nLance Stroll - FP2: 1:23.832, P12\n\"Today was all about getting into the rhythm at Yas Marina Circuit and building confidence with the car.\n\"The car felt okay in Free Practice Two, but we have a few things to work on over night and some areas we can improve on, and then we'll see how competitive we can be tomorrow.\"\nJak Crawford - FP1: 1:25.889, P19\n\"It was a really good, productive session.\n\"We tried some different things with the setup of the AMR25 and everything went smoothly.\n\"I drove here last year in the post-season test, so I had some good reference points and I felt I got up to speed quickly.\"\n1 / 4\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 05: Fernando Alonso of Spain driving the (14) Aston Martin F1 Team AMR25 Mercedes on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 05, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

That left Colapinto to really push the A525 in FP1, which he did with decent success. But when the lights came on for FP2, the Alpine faded to the back of the field. Neither driver was able to extract much pace out there, so making it out of Q1 tomorrow will be the first challenge for the French team.\nPierre Gasly - FP2: 1:24.963, P20\n“It was a difficult Free Practice 2 on our side today. We are going to need to find a lot more performance if we are to challenge for the top ten tomorrow when it counts. I think we have some evidence to explain where we are lacking and I am confident we can improve for tomorrow. There were a few things that did not work as expected. The balance was just too inconsistent and we seemed to lack grip across both cars in the second session. We will see what we can do and we will give it one final push this weekend as we close out the season.”\nFranco Colapinto - FP1: 1:24.855, P10; FP2: 1:24.771, P19\n“Today wasn't the easiest day and a difficult one to fully understand, as it felt like we took a step backwards from the afternoon to the evening session. We started the day well with a good feeling in the car, ending up not far off on the timesheet and more comparable to the teams around us. The second session was more difficult so we need to understand why that is and how we can improve for Qualifying. As we did in Qatar and in previous races, we've shown that as a team we can keep improving as the weekend goes on. We just need to sit down with the engineers and go over the data this evening and target a more positive Free Practice 3 where hopefully we can test and refine a few things.”\nPaul Aron - FP1: 1:25.204, P13\n“I am very grateful to the team for the Free Practice 1 outings this year. Today was another successful session where we were able to complete the whole run plan and work through some good set-up items. Hopefully that can all be beneficial to the team for the remainder of the weekend. Even though this was my fifth FP1 of the year, the third with the team, it certainly still brings its challenges, especially as it has been over one month since I last drove. In general, I was happy with the pace but we did not quite put it together on the Soft run so there is definitely room to improve. Now I will be watching and supporting closely for the remainder of the weekend and hopefully we can have a successful one as a team.”\n1 / 3\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 05: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A525 Renault on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 05, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

In both sessions we found some instances of graining, mainly on the front-right, which has the effect of slightly accelerating  degradation. In this context, the most consistent race tyres seem to be the medium and hard, whereas the soft appears to be more suited to a flying lap.\n\"One factor to bear in mind though is track evolution. The support races are laying down rubber onto a surface that was initially quite dirty, improving grip. This means that graining could well be reduced in the next couple of days, putting the soft C5 back into play.\n\"From what we just saw today, a one-stop strategy seems to be most likely. Nonetheless, as the weekend goes on, a two-stopper could also become a possibility. It’s not by chance that both McLarens and the Aston Martin of Alonso did not run the hard at all in FP2, saving a new set.\n\"An extra set of hard C3 tyres during the race gives more options in terms of strategy, especially if there’s a safety car, and delivers performance very similar to the medium C4. The performance gap between the C3 and C4 is currently around two tenths of a second, while there’s a bigger gap between medium and soft of about seven to eight tenths of a second.”"}

He made it through Q1 and Q2 using just the two sets of tyres to have two new sets of softs for Q3. On his first lap he received a tow from his team mate, Tsunoda making Q3 for the second straight weekend. That launched him well ahead of his rivals – but it proved unnecessary, as he went even faster on his second run, even though he did not get the same tow. He starts on pole, but still has it all to do tomorrow with Norris breathing down his neck from P2. As for Tsunoda, his Q3 was sacrificed to help his team mate, at the end of a difficult day that included an FP3 crash in the pit lane when Antonelli was released into his path. That damaged his floor, meaning he is on an older spec part for the rest of the weekend now.\nMax Verstappen, 1st, 1:22.207\n\"It was a Simply Lovely Qualifying. We did well the whole weekend, have been fine tuning the car and then also made some final changes which helped the car a little bit. This allowed me to push a bit more to the limit and extract the most out of the car. We were improving nicely in Qualifying and then found a little bit more lap time with the corners. The big question mark is can we keep up that pace in the race? Thank you to Yuki for the tow, it helped for sure, but it was nice of him to give up one of his laps. He was a great Team player, so thank you for that. Tomorrow, the plan is to win the race and then we need a bit of luck to win the Championship, it’s as simple as that. We will go all out and have nothing to lose, whether we need to attack or defend. The most important battle needs to happen tomorrow and we need to outscore them by 12 points; we knew that if we wanted to be in the fight we had to be first. I have the least to lose and I am very relaxed. It is exciting to be on Pole, but we just need a bit of luck for the rest of it and some Abu Dhabi magic.\"\nYuki Tsunoda, 10th, No time set in Q3\n“Because of the pit lane incident in FP3, we had to change back to the old floor on my car, which did compromise performance somewhat and was not ideal. I knew it could be difficult to get through to Q3 but I was able to do that. I have been able to help Max and that was always the aim, I am proud of that today. I will try to support Max as much as possible tomorrow, that is my goal and my main focus. It might not be a straightforward strategy but if I can help Max to win a fifth Drivers’ Championship, then that is the priority. The top 10 looks very tight, so let’s see what I can do.\"\nLaurent Mekies, Team Principal\n\"It really was an amazing job from everyone today, from Max, Yuki and the Team. Max could've taken pole on both his runs today he was that quick. We weren't the fastest on track yesterday, but the car has really improved with each session to get into a great condition for Quali this evening. Well done to everyone for having nailed the right window of the car which allowed us to extract everything from it. We managed to get both cars into Q3 which is great and Yuki did an excellent job on the first run with the tow he gave Max. Of course, there are no points on Saturday here, but we've given ourselves an opportunity to give it our all. Our full concentration and focus turns to maximising everything we can from the car tomorrow, because we cannot control what happens behind us. Everyone here and in Milton Keynes has worked hard to be in this position, fighting for titles to the very end, so it is a privileged position to be in. Whatever happens tomorrow, it has been a sensational end to the year for us.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Pole position qualifier Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates in parc ferme during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Bryn Lennon - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\nMcLaren\nPiastri closed the gap to his team mate in FP3, and then started Qualifying very well indeed with a storming lap in Q1. That meant two McLaren cars pushing each other close in the battle for pole. Both made Q3 with ease but having used one more set of tyres than rival Verstappen. That put them half a step behind on the first runs, with it all to do on the second runs in the top-10 shootout. Both nailed their laps, with Norris just 0.029s ahead of his team mate. But neither had an answer for the pace of the Red Bull. Nonetheless, if they finish where they start, Norris will be World Champion .\nLando Norris, 2nd, 1:22.408\n“We did everything we could do today, but just didn't have the pace in the car for Pole. I was happy with my lap, but I'm of course disappointed to not be on Pole for the final weekend of the year. For tomorrow, we'll focus on doing the best we can. As always, I want to win the race, so that's the goal.”\nOscar Piastri, 3rd, 1:22.437\n“I felt like we maximised what we could today. I was happy with my Q3 laps; we just didn't quite have the pace to answer Max. Our long run pace looks okay, so let's see what we can do tomorrow. I'll focus on delivering the best race I can, and we'll see what happens.”\nAndrea Stella, Team Principal\n“The final Qualifying session of the year is symbolic of the close displays we’ve seen from Lando and Oscar throughout the season. Overall, we can be reasonably happy with our performances as the drivers extracted everything from the car in what was an extremely tight session.\n“We’re now in a strong position to fight for the Championship tomorrow. We are aware that we’re not alone with very competitive drivers starting beside us on the first and second row. However, as a team, it is in our hands. We will make sure we maintain this strong position and execute our preparation at the highest level to be in condition to ensure the reward goes to a papaya driver at the Chequered Flag.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Pole position qualifier Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing and Second placed qualifier Lando Norris of Great Britain and McLaren congratulate each other in parc ferme during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Bryn Lennon - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\nMercedes\nRussell certainly looked in the mix from the word go on Saturday, winding up on top of the standings in FP3 to really give the championship rivals something to consider. He made Q3 comfortably and thus had two sets of fresh tyres to work with, but his car suddenly became more of a handful and after fighting it on his first lap, he got all out of shape in the final corner of his second hot lap. He was also tempted to try and get a tow from Verstappen, who would have loved a car in between himself and the papaya ones – but the timing did not work.\nAntonelli was eliminated in Q2, radioing afterwards to say the rear of his car was missing in action when it mattered. That ended a tricky day for the youngster, who suffered front wing damage when he was released in the pits into the path of Tsunoda in FP3, the duo making contact for which the team were later fined for an unsafe release.\nGeorge Russell, 4th, 1:22.645\n\"We were near the top of the timing screens in both Q1 and Q2, but we knew that Verstappen and the two McLarens had more pace to show come Q3. That turned out to be the case, and I think P4 was ultimately us maximising the package we had this evening. Q3 didn’t go too smoothly on our side but I don’t think we were ever in the fight for the front-row.\n\"Tomorrow’s race will be interesting with the three title contenders starting ahead of us. On ultimate pace, I don’t believe that our race is with them but there could be some strategic implications of that battle that open opportunities for us. We will be considering every eventuality that can help us gain positions and ultimately bring home the points we need to secure P2 in the Constructors’ Championship. That is our only focus for tomorrow and, if we can do that, we can end the season on a high.\"\nKimi Antonelli, 14th, 1:23.080\n\"Qualifying started well in Q1. I was happy with the balance of the car and was able to extract a decent lap time out of it. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case in Q2, and we were knocked out in what was a very tight session. That was a shame as I think we had the pace to be starting in the top six for tomorrow’s race.\n\"Despite tonight’s disappointment, we will refocus now for Sunday’s race. We will do our best to get back into the points and secure P2 in the Constructors’ Championship for the team. Every point could be crucial so that is what my full focus is on. It is important for all of us that we achieve that and end the season on a positive note. Hopefully we can do that and I can end my rookie season in F1 on a high.\"\nToto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport\n\"Qualifying didn’t go quite the way we wanted today. P4 is an OK position to start but obviously P14 is less so. The car has been on a bit of a knife’s edge this weekend. At moments we’ve had good performance, but it’s been difficult to extract consistently. We saw that this evening where we topped Q2 but also had one car fail to make it through. The narrow gaps between all cars also meant that any small mistake was punished heavily.\n\"Despite having the three drivers who will be fighting for the title in front of him tomorrow, I am sure George will just be focused on driving his own race. He will be looking to end his season on a high and hopefully he can do that by getting on the podium. That will be the same with Kimi even though it will be a challenge for him to fight back into the major points-scoring positions. Let’s see how it all plays out though, and we will be ready to take advantage of any opportunities that come our way.\"\nAndrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director\n\"The session was a bit of a disappointment considering that we'd shown good pace earlier today and in the opening stages of qualifying. George was the only car to get through Q1 on a single new set of Soft tyres and Kimi's second push lap put him P3. For Kimi though, his session began it to unravel in Q2. We didn't change anything in our approach, but he started to get the odd snap which in turn caused high temperatures and compounded these issues. Unfortunately, he couldn't reproduce his Q1 pace and finished the session in P14.\n\"George was quickest in Q2, once again on a single new set of Soft tyres but then had similar issues with a loss of rear grip in Q3. With the pace of Verstappen in the Red Bull and the two McLarens, P4 wasn’t a bad result. It was slightly frustrating given what we had seen earlier but if we have good race pace tomorrow, we can still score good points with both cars. That is our sole focus as we look to bring home P2 in the Constructors’ Championship.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W16 on track during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Clive Rose/Getty Images)\nFerrari\nIt was a very mixed bag for Ferrari in Abu Dhabi. Leclerc changed his car completely overnight, and seemed much happier in FP3. His car still looked a handful, but he made it to Q3 and qualified a pretty decent P5 – but has no idea what his race pace will be like, having made so many set-up changes. But Hamilton had a very tough day. He spun out and crashed in FP3 , and although the team managed to rebuild his car in time for Qualifying, he made a mistake on his last flying run. That meant a third straight Q1 exit for the Brit – fourth if you include Sprint Qualifying from Qatar.\nCharles Leclerc, 5th, 1:22.730\n\"I’m satisfied with my lap in Q3 and I don’t think there was much more to extract today. I feel that our team has done a really good job in turning things around this weekend. We made some changes on the set-up between FP2 and FP3, and if paid off. I’m looking forward to the race tomorrow, to see if the changes we made will also help us to get ahead in the race. We can’t get our hopes up too high, because the cars ahead are very fast. It’s up to us to maximise our result tomorrow, and I’ll do my best to take action at the start and hope to bring home a last podium for our whole team this season.\"\nLewis Hamilton, 16th, 1:23.394\n\"Clearly it wasn’t the result we were aiming for today. The team did a great job after FP3, in getting the car ready in time for qualifying, but a mistake in the last sector cost us. I know this track well and I’ll be aiming to deliver a more positive result for the team tomorrow.\"\nFred Vasseur, Team Principal\n\"Overall, we are happy with Charles’ result, as we had a very tough time in both Friday sessions and when it came to deciding on today’s set-up we were quite aggressive and it paid off. For sure, if practice had been better then maybe we could have fought for an even better position, but it is what it is. Now, let’s see what happens tomorrow, let’s see what our race pace is like. It’s been difficult for Lewis, because he did not drive in FP1, having given up his seat to Arthur, and then came the crash halfway through FP3 and in this kind of situation where there are only two tenths separating P4 and P18 if you miss so much running, it’s too much to recover from. You can’t produce a performance based just on FP2. Now let's focus on how to do the best possible for our team to get the best result to end the season well.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Charles Leclerc of Monaco driving the (16) Scuderia Ferrari SF-25 on track during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty Images)\nAston Martin\nAlonso admitted to plenty of changes to the car after a disappointing Friday, and whatever he did clearly worked. He was right in the mix at the front in FP3 and the early stages of Qualifying, and made it to Q3 for the third straight race. From there he grabbed the ‘best of the rest’ slot for his team, as Aston Martin begin the slightly unlikely task of trying to chase down Racing Bulls for sixth in the championship. As for Stroll , he exited in Q2 and thus starts a fair few places back.\nFernando Alonso, 6th, 1:22.902\n\"Extremely happy to finish Qualifying in P6. I am surprised by such a strong result on a circuit with so many low-speed corners, but it is clear the setup changes we made overnight worked well. Hopefully we can maintain this pace tomorrow and continue building momentum throughout the weekend. The aim is to secure some valuable points in the final race of the season.\"\nLance Stroll, 15th, 1:23.097\n\"It was a super tight Qualifying today and we were looking good for Q3, but missed it in the end by less than one tenth. I had a bit of a messy Turn 14 and lost time there on my final push lap in Q2 so that's where it got away from us. When it's that tight, a small margin makes a big difference so a good effort today, but would have hoped for a bit more.\"\nMike Krack, Chief Trackside Officer\n\"It was an exceptionally close field today in the Qualifying session. Lance progressed into Q2, delivering a series of clean laps and narrowly missing out on a spot in Q3 by less than a tenth of a second. Fernando, meanwhile, advanced to Q3 and put in a strong performance to secure P6. We hope this puts us in a good position to score points in the final race of the season tomorrow – we will aim to maximise every opportunity.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Fernando Alonso of Spain driving the (14) Aston Martin F1 Team AMR25 Mercedes on track during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

But when it came to Q1, Bortoleto was the one to scrape into Q2 while Hulkenberg somewhat surprisingly exited. The Brazilian found a much better turn of speed in Q2 to make it to the top-10 shootout for the first time since Monza. He grabbed seventh on the grid for his joint-best Qualifying of the year, as he looks to finish his rookie season in the points one last time.\nNico Hulkenberg, 18th, 1:23.450\n\"It’s very disappointing, it feels we just tripped over ourselves today, especially as the car’s setup felt very good and there was the potential for a very good result. The run plan and sequence just didn’t work out: we were the last car out there. We waited long in the pitlane, which meant the tyres were a bit too cold, and I hit a lot of traffic both on the out-lap and the timed lap. With the field as tight as it has been at the last few events, those small margins make a big difference, and we let it slip through our fingers. The potential in the car was there earlier in the weekend and even this morning, but we didn’t put it together in Q1 and made our lives very hard for tomorrow. Following and overtaking here are very difficult with this generation of cars, so starting from the back will be a challenge, but we’ll do what we can from there.\"\nGabriel Bortoleto, 7th, 1:22.904\n“It feels great to finish the season with a qualifying like this one. The whole session was incredibly tight: we were just a few thousandths away from being knocked out in Q1, then pulled out a mega lap in Q2 and kept it strong in Q3 as well. I think it’s been a really good performance today, one to be proud of, and hopefully we can turn it into a top ten finish tomorrow – it would be a great way to wrap up the season. The car has been working well, and we’ve been making the right changes to keep up with the shifting conditions from day to night. It’s never easy, but we found a balance I was really happy with. Now, the goal is to hold our position at the start and try to make our way forward.”\nJonathan Wheatley, Team Principal\n“First of all, I want to apologise to Nico. He was absolutely capable of making it into Q3, but the timing was compromised, which affected his opportunity to progress to Q2.\n“On the other side of the garage, though, it was an incredible performance from Gabi. He delivered exactly what was needed on every lap. It was great to be fighting up there with the front-runners, and he fully earned that outstanding qualifying position. He’s really shown his class today.\n“Looking ahead to tomorrow, we’re starting from a strong place, but our key competitors are all around us. There’s no clear advantage within that group, and our goal is very clearly to outscore Haas and Aston Martin. It’s going to be tougher than we originally expected, but still within our reach. Our focus now is on maximising the opportunities for both cars, doing everything we can to score points and to help Nico recover and get back into the best possible position.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Gabriel Bortoleto of Brazil driving the (5) Kick Sauber C45 Ferrari on track during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

But after Ocon managed a last-gasp lap to make it out of Q1, he excelled in Q2, pulling a mega lap out of the bag. That landed him in Q3 for the first time since Monaco, while Bearman was left slightly disappointed with P11 after looking in the fight for the third row. But both drivers can fight for points from there, which they need to, with rival Aston Martin having Alonso up the road in sixth.\nEsteban Ocon, 8th, 1:22.913\n“I’m super happy – delighted to say the least. It was honestly the lowest moment of the season yesterday, it was really a bad feeling being half a second away from where we should be. We were lost and changed everything on the car overnight, and the car today feels much better. It’s transformed, and we’re suddenly where we should be, so a big thanks to the team for their continual support. In the tough times, we’ve stuck together, and that makes the difference. It’s a bit late, so there are some regrets there as we could’ve had a lot more points, but we’ll take today, review things, and hopefully it's a good foundation for next year. It’s all to play for tomorrow, we start from the points, and hopefully we convert that.”\nOliver Bearman, 11th, 1:23.041\n“It’s a shame to miss out, but it was a very tight session and every millisecond counted out there tonight. Ultimately, I had a bit of an interrupted qualifying, being on a used set for my first run in Q2, then, as a result, it was a big jump to go onto the new set. The car has the pace, but I just didn’t quite put the lap together. I’m looking forward to the race tomorrow as I think there will be some opportunities, and generally the car has been quick all weekend.”\nAyao Komatsu, Team Principal\n“I’m very happy to get Esteban back up there in qualifying today. He was the best part of half a second off it yesterday, without any obvious issues. Overnight, we made set-up changes to the car, and that worked very well straight away. That was very pleasing and gives the team confidence, and of course it gives lots of confidence to Esteban as well. In Q1, we operated well – using two new sets of tires with Esteban – and although we knew there was a chance of only needing one set with Ollie, the margin was too tight to park it.\n\"In Q2, Esteban did a great job. Ollie’s reference wasn’t a new tire because he kept two new sets of medium tires for the race, which meant he’d have one less set for Q2. He missed getting into Q3 by seven thousandths of a second, and the frustrating thing is you could see the loss in a straight line, so we’re looking into that.\n\"Esteban in Q3 – using one set of used and one set of new softs – did a very good job. It’s very difficult around here to put a perfect lap together, so for us to be frustrated about losing P6 by one hundredth, but being where we were yesterday, we’ve come a long way. The potential is high with this car, and what Ollie has felt all weekend is very good. Tomorrow, we need to get a good start, focus on ourselves, race hard and do the best we can. What will happen, will happen, but I don’t think we can be too hung up on the result, we just need to concentrate on our own race.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Haas F1 VF-25 Ferrari on track during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Hadjar did make Q3 for the team, winding up ninth, and will be targeting points in the final race of his rookie season. Lawson is a few places back but not out of contention for the top 10, especially if the team gamble and split strategies.\nIsack Hadjar, 9th, 1:23.072\n\"It was a decent day today. Compared to yesterday, I’m really happy as I definitely made a step up in my driving, which allowed us to find something special and get to Q3. In Q2, I put it all together and did a very good lap, which unfortunately I couldn’t repeat in Q3 as I didn’t find more grip. I have no regrets as I think P9 was our best possible result today, and we maximised what we had to do in a track that doesn’t suit our car as much as Qatar did. Tomorrow should be a one-stop race, but yesterday we noticed a higher track degradation than expected, so I think we’ll keep having a look at it and we’ll give our best to try and score points.”\nLiam Lawson, 13th, 1:23.077\n\"The car felt quick during Quali, so it's frustrating to be out in Q2. We ended up playing things too conservatively today by using three sets of tyres in Q1, which we didn't need to do. It meant we only had one new set for Q2, resulting in us missing out on Q3 by a small margin. After missing FP1 yesterday, a lot of our data was taken from FP2, which was the first session in the car for me. In hindsight, we were over cautious, so it's something we'll learn from going into next year.”\nGuillaume Dezoteux, Head of Vehicle Performance\n“With the track temperature swinging between afternoon and evening sessions, it’s always difficult here to optimise the cars, assess the performance and relative competitiveness in Free Practice 3. Qualifying was extremely tight, once again. Both cars got through Q1 but the gaps were small, and perfect execution was required to progress in the session. In Q2, we had all 15 cars within 367 milliseconds! Isack went through after a great second lap in new tyres, while Liam got knocked out by less than half a tenth. Finally, in Q3, Isack secured P9 on the grid, extracting everything from the car and the tyres. Our cars are in a good position for the race but our direct competitors are there too. Tomorrow, the tyre management will be key. It’s a long race and we will give everything to finish in the points.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Isack Hadjar of France and Visa Cash App Racing Bulls prepares to drive in the garage during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

They have not been helped by some of their rivals going well here, nor the fact the gaps in the midfield are incredibly tight. As such, Albon exited in Q1 and Sainz in Q2. But with fifth in the championship already secure, those two can race without too much pressure tomorrow and see what happens.\nAlex Albon, 17th, 1:23.416\n\"Difficult session. We couldn’t get the tyres in the right window and hit traffic in the final sector of the lap. There were a few small details which I couldn’t quite nail and, with such a tight field, every millisecond counts. Strategy will make a big difference in the race tomorrow, so it will be interesting to see how each team approaches it. Tomorrow will be tough, but we’ll look to take advantage of any opportunities that come our way.\"\nCarlos Sainz, 12th, 1:23.042\n\"I’m relatively happy with where we are today, as we made a good step from the practice sessions. It was one of the tightest sessions I remember, with only one tenth separating P6-P15 in Q2, and I unfortunately fell short by 0.008 of a second. For tomorrow, it’s looking to be on the limit between a one and a two-stop race, which can result in interesting strategies. I’m confident we can fight to make our way into the points, and the aim is to finish off the 2025 season strong!\"\nJames Vowles, Team Principal\n\"First of all, congratulations to Max. Really impressive laps out there and he was dominant through sector 3. Speaking of which, that was the sector we couldn't quite get right today. The gaps were miniscule. Just a handful of milliseconds separated five cars but that is the state of the sport today and it's brilliant – it is really the highest level of competition we have ever seen, and you have to get absolutely everything perfect. In the case of Carlos today, he was strong everywhere, we just need to review what else we can do to get more performance out of sector 3. With Alex, when the field is this tight, just a tenth punishes you, but he is competitive and I'm confident we can come back fighting tomorrow. These races are unpredictable and we're in the best seat in the house to see what happens on race day.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Twelfth placed qualifier Carlos Sainz of Spain and Williams looks on during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

They occupy the back row, with both drivers losing lap times in Q1 to boot after exceeding track limits. In the end Gasly out-qualified Colapinto for the sixth straight race, at the end of a tricky year for the team.\nPierre Gasly, 19th, 1:23.468\n“We did a great job overnight to improve the car and it felt like we made a good step from yesterday. The car was set-up well but today's result is, quite honestly, just a reflection of our performance at this track. It was a very tight Qualifying throughout and we have been on the wrong end of a tenth or two to our competitors across the weekend so far. We had to go for it on the final run on Softs as we had the lap time deletion for track limits on my first run. I was very happy with my final lap, all the corners came together and that was really all we had in our hands. We have the final race of the season tomorrow. It is also the final race with our colleagues from Viry on the power unit side. I am very grateful for everything they have done especially in my Alpine career. We will give it our all for them and see what result we come out with at the end.”\nFranco Colapinto, 20th, 1:23.890\n“The difficulties of yesterday carried over to today unfortunately. I think Pierre found more pace and did a better job than me. We made some changes which made a difference, but I still didn't feel totally comfortable. I felt in a decent place at the start of the weekend, and we need to understand why we haven't been able to make the same improvements across the weekend as others did. We put a lot of pressure on our final lap due to track limits, which was my own doing. There are a few places around the lap where you're right on the limit, and the margins are so tight, you have to push or risk losing time. We need to work hard overnight and give it our best tomorrow. It's an important day for everyone at the team at the final race for Viry, so we'll give it our all to try and give them a nice result.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A525 Renault leads Andrea Kimi Antonelli of Italy driving the (12) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W16 on track during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

In qualifying, some drivers chose to keep new soft C5 tyres for the quickest laps in the final Q3 session, even though we saw that used softs were still capable of setting fast times after a few cool-down laps.\nLooking at the tyre sets that the teams have kept back for the race, there are two different approaches. McLaren is the only team that has saved two sets of new hards, while most other teams – including Red Bull – have saved two sets of mediums. This shows that teams are keeping the possibility of two stops open, but only McLaren – the winners of the constructors’ championship this year – have gone for the most conservative option.\nThe two quickest strategies tomorrow are one-stoppers. One option is to start on the medium and switch to the hard between laps 20 and 26. An alternative is to start on the hard and then take advantage of the soft’s extra performance by stopping between laps 39 and 45.\nA two-stop strategy seems to be a bit less competitive, especially given the difficulty of overtaking here. The best way to do it is with a combination of medium and hard for the first two stints, followed by a final stint on the medium – which in theory would be quicker for the run to the flag than the hard or the soft under these circumstances.\nIt's not been possible to assess how graining has progressed from the short runs seen today, but there is no evidence of it so far this evening. Track evolution suggests that the situation will be better compared to Friday, especially thanks to the tyre management that we expect from the drivers during the Grand Prix.”"}

He one-stopped to the flag, and had the ability to throw in a free second stop had he wanted to, such was his advantage over the field. That would have enabled Red Bull to enact some gamesmanship to try and swing the title fight his way, but in the end they opted for the victory , knowing the chances of disturbing McLaren’s two drivers was remote at best. As for Tsunoda, he played the team game in his final race for Red Bull, attempting to hold up Norris once the McLaren man pitted. But in doing so he forced Norris wide off the track and received a five-second time penalty for his troubles.\nMax Verstappen, 1st\n“I’m very proud of the whole Team and I’m so proud of the incredible turnaround that we had. We never gave up and always believed we could turn things around and never stopped trying. We could have very easily just have given up, but we kept pushing, looking for improvements and always believed. This season has been a massive rollercoaster, with lots of tough moments and feelings, but I’m so proud of everyone and we have really come together as a Team. The turnaround in the second half of the season was incredible and pretty crazy that we could do that and we kept overcoming a lot of things as a Team. Today has been a lot of fun, especially winning the race in such a dominant way. We had an incredible weekend and did everything as best as we could, so ultimately I feel good today. Although not winning a championship by two points looks painful, going back to Zandvoort we were behind by over 100 points, so am very proud of what we have achieved. Of course, for Lando this is something very special and I hope he enjoys it a lot. The first Championship win is the most emotional one and it is something you dream of since you were a little kid. His family are here and I hope he enjoys tonight with his Team. Finally, I wanted to thank the whole Team in the factory and on track: we never gave up and always believed. I am very proud of the people that I work with, they are my second family.\"\nYuki Tsunoda, 14th\n\"I really tried my absolute best to score points today, and I think there could have been potential to do so, but the penalty made it tricky. We opted for a different strategy, and we were running well until the battle with Lando. I tried to hold him up, but he was pretty fast, and then I ended up with a frustrating penalty. Once I came out for the second stint, it was really challenging to pass. I can look back on this year knowing that I gave it everything until the end. There were lots of times this season where I lacked that bit of luck you sometimes need to make the difference, but that's racing. A big congratulations to Lando—he has been superb all year and drove a solid race tonight to win his first title. Also, congratulations to Max for his victory and an amazing season. Between himself and the Team, they put together a brilliant effort to challenge until the very end and just missed out. He is the best driver on the grid, seeing him work and extract everything that he does is, just shows how good he is, and he has the mentality to go with it, it's very inspiring to see. I'd like to say thank you to the engineers, mechanics, and the entire Team for this season, and I'll still be around next season, so it's not a proper goodbye.\"\nLaurent Mekies, Team Principal\n\"Firstly, congratulations to Lando and McLaren. They have been superb all year and have been our fiercest competitors this season, so a huge well-done to their whole team. It was so tight this year, and we put up a really great fight right to the end, finishing with a dominant display today. We didn’t expect to put in a performance like that around this track, so a big credit to the Team and to Max for getting the car into a position to do exactly that. Starting from pole, we knew the win could be in our hands, and Max was perfect from start to finish, with excellent tyre management to see us through. I’d also like to thank Yuki, who played the team game today, as he did last night, and we thank him for never giving up this season. We simply could not have done anything more. The dominant feeling is one of pride for this sensational turnaround. The effort that every single person in this Team, in the campus and on the race track, has put in is nothing short of incredible. We showed true racing spirit - the Red Bull spirit - right up to the very last lap.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Race winner Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates on arrival in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Neither had the pace to fight with the Red Bull of Verstappen, though, for the win. Piastri on the hard tyres overtook Norris on the opening lap and kept the Dutchman honest, staying out for a long first stint and one-stopping on his way to the flag. Norris had to work harder in the opening stages on the mediums to keep a feisty Leclerc at bay. He mirrored the Ferrari man’s two-stop strategy to ensure he stayed in P3, which was all he needed in the end for that coveted Drivers’ crown.\nLando Norris, 3rd\n\"We did it, World Champion! This is for everyone that's been there for me on this journey. For my family, for my team, and for everyone at McLaren.\n“It's been a tough season, Oscar and Max are incredible competitors and have done an incredible job all year. It's been a privilege to get to race them this year, congratulations to them on their amazing seasons.\n“I'm so proud, not because I'm World Champion, but because of everything those around me have given up to make this possible. Making them happy and rewarding their sacrifices and hard work is what makes me proud.”\nOscar Piastri, 2nd\n\"Congratulations to Lando on the Championship win, it was great to battle with him all the way to the end, and it's a lovely moment for the team. It was a really strong race to finish out this year, we took a risk on strategy, and it paid off, but we just didn't have an answer to Max.\n\"It's been an amazing season and one I am very proud of. We'll take everything we've learnt and head into 2026 as the strongest driver I've ever been. I am excited to see what we can achieve next year.\"\nAndrea Stella, Team Principal\n“Today, we celebrate an extraordinary achievement for the entire McLaren Racing family. The main feeling is that we are incredibly proud to take home a maiden 2025 FIA Formula 1 Drivers’ Championship for Lando. This is a fantastic end to what has been a hard-fought season, one that has tested and brought out the best in everyone across the team. All the men and women in Woking have responded to the call how we had wished to elevate the game and level of performance following our success last season.\n“While only one driver can take the Drivers’ Championship title each season, to be in a situation where both Lando and Oscar were challenging at the sharp end against a four-time World Champion in Max Verstappen, was always an ambition and not a problem. The demand of this was huge, but we did it the McLaren way, even when we had our bumps on in the road, everyone stuck to our culture which showed our incredible unity, and I’m so happy that the team have been rewarded with this success.\n“Lando and Oscar have been outstanding all year both on and off track, showing the true values of what it means to be a McLaren team member. Together they have secured a combined 14 wins and a total of 34 podiums which also delivered the 2025 FIA Formula 1 Constructors’ Championship, our 10th as a team and also our first Championship double since the team’s iconic 1998 season.\n“None of this would be possible without the unwavering support of our shareholders, partners, people, and fans, as well as our long-standing colleagues at HHP who have contributed to another year of successful collaboration.\n“Thank you for being on this journey with us. We’ll make sure we celebrate this moment together before getting our heads down and focusing on the upcoming challenge in 2026.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: 2025 F1 World Drivers Champion Lando Norris of Great Britain and McLaren celebrates with his team during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Bryn Lennon - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\nFerrari\nLeclerc was racy off the line, picking off Russell and giving Norris plenty to think about in the first stint. He ran in DRS range of the McLaren man for lap after lap, but could not find a way through. He was quick in the second and third stints, too, before his charge faded late on and he had to make do with P4. Hamilton started on the softs and climbed right up the order after an early switch to the hard tyre. He was the first to gamble on a two-stop strategy and it paid dividends as he came home in the points despite starting from P16 on the grid.\nCharles Leclerc, 4th\n\"I gave it everything and our team executed the race perfectly. Unfortunately, P4 was all there was in it for us today. I really wanted to finish the season on a high, bringing home a podium for everyone, and I was close to Lando (Norris) in a few moments of the race, but it was not enough to make a pass.\n\"Congratulations to Lando for his first title. He has been doing an incredible job of driving this year and it’s fully deserved.\n\"A huge thank you to our whole team, both at the track and at home in Italy, for all the hard work put in this year, as well as our Tifosi for their ongoing support. It’s been a tough season for us.\n\"Next season is still a blank slate, and we don’t know where the other teams stand, so we don’t have any real expectations yet. After this week, we will head back to Maranello to regroup, and our job will be to focus all our efforts on preparing for the season ahead as best as we can.\"\nLewis Hamilton, 8th\n\"I’m pleased with today’s drive. We made good progress, overtook a lot of cars, and got ourselves back into the points. The two-stop strategy worked well so thank you to the team.\n\"It’s been a tough season, but the kindness and hard work of everyone at Ferrari means a lot to me. I stand with team and know we have better times ahead. After testing, I’m looking forward to taking some time to switch off, spend time with my family and friends and will come back refreshed and stronger in January.\n\"Congratulations to Lando. It’s great to see a fellow Brit win the championship. I’m proud of the work he’s put in over the years and this result is fully deserved.\"\nFred Vasseur, Team Principal\n\"First of all congratulations to Lando on winning the title. Ever since his days in karting it was obvious that he has a special talent and this title is well deserved and well done also to McLaren for giving him the equipment to get the job done.\n\"Overall, this has not been a bad weekend for us in terms of pure performance, but it came a bit too late following a very tough start on Friday after which the team at the track and back in the factory did a very good job to recover for Saturday, by making very big changes to the cars. However, when you have to recover like this, it’s all about fine tuning the details and we weren’t able to do that. That affected our qualifying as the field was so close and then today our race pace was good and with Charles we were matching Lando’s pace, but in the current F1 where the gaps are so small, if you leave anything on the table you pay the price. Lewis also had a good race with very strong pace, he pulled off some nice overtaking moves and the motivation was there. But across the whole team, if we want better results we must work on having better weekends from the start of practice.\n\"I want to thank everyone in the team at the track and all the people back in Maranello for all their hard work all year and of course thanks also to the Tifosi for their support this season, because even when we were struggling, and we had some very tough weekends, they were always behind us, always supportive and you can’t imagine the positive energy this has given us throughout all the year.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Charles Leclerc of Monaco driving the (16) Scuderia Ferrari SF-25 on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by James Sutton - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\nMercedes\nRussell had plenty of wheelspin off the line, and dropped behind Leclerc and Alonso which was far from ideal. He managed to pick off the Aston Martin man, but could not get the Ferrari ahead. As such, he stopped early to try the undercut, which very nearly worked. But he lost pace in the last stint and came home a distant fifth - which was more than enough to secure P2 in the Constructors’ for Mercedes. As for Antonelli , he started on the hard tyre but could not quite make that strategy play out after getting stuck in a DRS train for much of the race.\nGeorge Russell, 5th\n\"That was a very tough race for us this evening. We struggled to find the pace that would threaten those ahead throughout the whole Grand Prix. I had a poor start and dropped down to P6; I got back ahead of Alonso to take P5, but it was a lonely night from there. We knew in normal circumstances that we likely didn’t have the pace to challenge for the podium, but it was still frustrating.\n\"Whilst the season didn’t end in the way we wanted, we can be pleased that we secured P2 in the Constructors’. It has been a challenging four years in this ground effect era for us as a team and getting P2 was definitely our aim from after the summer break. We’ve ticked that box but ultimately, we want more than this and that is what we are fully focused on delivering in 2026 with the seismic rules change.\n\"Finally, I want to wish congratulations to Lando (Norris) as he becomes World Champion. We’ve raced together for so long and he is more than deserving of the title. Hopefully we can do battle on track next year for the 2026 crown!\"\nKimi Antonelli, 15th\n\"I struggled with the balance of the car this evening and didn’t have the pace to get back into the points sadly. It was a tough night and a difficult race and that is unfortunate. We’d enjoyed a good run of Grands Prix up to that point but that’s racing sometimes. We’ve got some work to do with the test on Tuesday and our full focus is already on 2026.\n\"It’s been quite a journey this season. It’s not the way we wanted to end the year, but the most important thing is that we brought home P2 in the Constructors’ Championship. Happily, we were able to do that. Over the winter, we will look back over the season, see where we could have done better, and come back much stronger.\n\"Congratulations to Lando (Norris) too. He deserves it but also well done to both Max (Verstappen) and Oscar (Piastri) who have also been brilliant this year. It was a great battle all year.\"\nToto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport\n\"Congratulations firstly to Lando Norris on winning the World Championship. He is a worthy winner; I am really happy for him and everyone that is close to him. His parents will be quite rightly proud of his achievement, and I am sure they will enjoy it. Congratulations also to Zak (Brown) and Andrea (Stella); they have done a great job at McLaren to secure both titles this year.\n\"Our race can be summed up in one word: mediocre. It was a lonely one for George who wasn’t threatened from behind but didn’t have the pace of the front four cars. He was managing his tyres to bring the car home on the one-stop, and he did that successfully. For Kimi, he tried his best from a difficult starting position, but we just didn’t have the speed in the car to enable him to get back into the points. It is not the way we wanted to end the year, but we can be pleased we secured P2 in the Constructors’. Since the midpoint of the season, that has been our aim. It is not what we as Mercedes ultimately want to be fighting for though and hopefully, we can prove ourselves worthy of being in a world title fight next year.\"\nAndrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director\n\"That was an underwhelming way to end our season. We came into the race hoping to fight for the podium with George and to help Kimi battle back into a solid points scoring position. Unfortunately, we didn't have the pace today to do that and had to bear a frustrating evening. Both drivers lost places at the start and things didn't improve much from there. George was in no man's land between the top four and the rest of the field. He drove sensibly to bring the car home P5. For Kimi, he needed a good start and a strong car to recover from qualifying and unfortunately did not have either.\n\"We're pleased to have secured second place in the Constructors’ Championship in an entertaining, season long battle with Ferrari and Red Bull, we go into the winter very mindful that McLaren won this championship comfortably. We look forward to the immense challenge of the new regulations; we've been working hard on the W17 for a long time and will redouble our efforts across the winter in a bid to get back to winning ways.\n\"Finally, well done to Lando. He drove brilliantly in the final races and is a worthy champion.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Andrea Kimi Antonelli of Italy driving the (12) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W16 leads George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W16 on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Although he dropped back, he managed to keep the rest of the midfield at bay. Pitting with the top runners, Alonso remained competitive throughout to secure sixth place and seventh in the championship for Aston Martin. As for Stroll , he ran a very long first stint on the hard tyre. When he eventually pitted, he was quick on the mediums and overtook Bortoleto late on to climb into the points. He finished ninth, was demoted to P11 when a time penalty was applied for changing direction too many times… only for Bearman to receive a time penalty himself, which promoted Stroll back to the points.\nFernando Alonso, 6th\n\"It is great to finish the season with a strong P6 here in Abu Dhabi. Our race pace hasn't always matched our qualifying recently, so a solid Sunday here feels very good. It's been a challenging year, and I want to thank the whole team for their hard work all season.

And congratulations to Lando on his first World Championship; it is a special moment for any young driver, and he deserves it.\"\nLance Stroll, 10th\n\"It was a fun race, some great overtakes and good strategy by the team today, and nice to pick up a point at the final race at Yas Marina Circuit. In hindsight, we could've maybe pitted a lap or two earlier and finished even further up in the points. This year has been a tough one for the team, we haven't been as competitive as we wanted to be, so finishing this season with a positive result and P7 in the Constructors' Championship is good.\"\nMike Krack, Chief Trackside Officer\n\"Firstly, congratulations to McLaren and Lando for a well-deserved end to their season. For us, it was great to complete the final race of 2025 on a positive note, with a double-points finish.\n\"Fernando drove a great race, finishing in P6 and bringing home eight valuable points for the team.

He even kept a charging Hamilton at bay for the last chunk of the race to record his best result since Monaco. As for Bearman , he was on the fringes of the points in the closing stages but received a five-second time penalty for more than one change of direction in a battle with Stroll, which ended any chance of finishing his rookie season in the top 10.\nEsteban Ocon, 7th\n“I’m very happy to finish the year this way. I think it was a really strong race from our side, and it was the maximum that we could’ve done. We fought with Fernando Alonso the whole race, it was definitely a big fight as he was matching my middle sector, it was really close, and there was a lot of overtaking all the way to the end. It wasn't quite enough to finish ahead of Aston Martin in the Constructors’ Championship. It’s a bittersweet taste, but it’s definitely a good last race that gives us a solid platform to build on next year.\"\nOliver Bearman, 12th\n“Overall, it was a good race. We pitted on the early side, but we managed to hold others off. To get penalized for more than one change of direction with Stroll – I broke the tow once, which is allowed by regulation, and then I defended the inside line for the rest of the straight. I’m looking forward to the winter break now, we built really strong foundations for this year, and that’s positive, and thanks once again to the whole team for everything this year.”\nAyao Komatsu, Team Principal\n“At the start of the day, we aimed to get both cars into the points. We achieved it until Ollie’s penalty – which I thought was really harsh, however – that’s the rule. To cross the line in P7 and P10 is a really good job from everyone, as we started from P8 and P11. We raced really hard, really well, and there was huge pressure trying to get P7 in the Constructors’ Championship, but everyone stayed calm. The pit stops were good, especially the second one, but I knew we’d bounce back – that team has done a great job this year, ending on a high.\n\"We couldn’t quite reach our target of beating Aston Martin today, but those championship positions don’t happen over one race, that happens over the course of 24 races. I’m very happy to say we should be proud of ourselves, how we improved this year and scored 79 points. Last year we finished P7 on 58 points, but this year the competition is so much tighter, and in the last seven races, we scored in six of them. It’s amazing that we’ve improved the cars two years in a row and finished the season on a high, it gives us confidence going into next year. I want to say thank you to everyone in this team, you should be proud of yourselves, and this is an achievement from everyone. I’m very happy to be working with this group of people, I couldn’t be prouder.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Haas F1 VF-25 Ferrari on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

But once he pitted for fresh rubber, the Brazilian got bogged down in the midfield. Hulkenberg was on a different strategy, after starting on the softs and pitting early. Despite some contact with Gasly, he managed to climb up the order and was running close to his team mate late on. Bortoleto lost out to Stroll who was on much fresher tyres and finished out of the points, but Hulkenberg gained a position when the Canadian’s penalty was applied, to ensure Kick Sauber earned some points in their last race before becoming Audi.\nNico Hulkenberg, 9th\n“Scoring two points, after a disappointing Saturday and coming from P18, is definitely something I am very, very pleased with. It’s not easy to move forward through the field here, especially when everyone is roughly on the same race pace. So all things considered, I’m very happy with P9 – it's a good way to end the last race of the season. It’s also a nice way to say goodbye to Sauber — Peter has such a legacy, he’s been in the industry so long and I have big respect for what he’s achieved.\n“I think it was definitely a good season — a lot of positive things happened. We developed, evolved and grew as a team, and we put in a couple of really good highlights. The podium was nice to finally tick off my shoulder; I was very happy about that. Barcelona, Budapest, Monza, Austin — many really strong weekends, and of course a few where we didn’t maximise everything, but that’s the challenge in a long season. All in all, I think we can be relatively satisfied. We’ll digest the season now, enjoy the break, and then look ahead to the new chapter that is waiting for us.”\nGabriel Bortoleto, 11th\n“I'm not going to lie – it's a bit disappointing to have finished just outside of the points today. Unfortunately, we struggled with bouncing from the first lap, and I don’t think we maximised our race as we should have. It’s a shame, because the car felt amazing yesterday and I really felt we could have scored some points today. Looking back at my first Formula One season, it’s been a special year for me with several good results and strong quali sessions, so there's definitely lots to be proud of – I couldn't have done this without the support of the team. It was a good and valuable year. The season is in the books now and I am looking forward to our future.  I'm already keen to start working on next year and hopefully fight for bigger things.”\nJonathan Wheatley, Team Principal\n“First, I want to extend my congratulations to Lando on securing his first championship. It was an incredible showdown and a fantastic spectacle to watch from the pit wall.\n“Although there is a sense of disappointment today, it comes at the end of what has been an extraordinary season. We have experienced highs and lows, and ultimately scored points well beyond our initial expectations. To finish with 70 points and only place P9 in the Constructors’ Championship is unprecedented and shows what a close season this has been.\n“Today once again highlighted the unpredictability of our year. We think a car issue resulted in Gabi lacking pace and, in hindsight, an earlier swap to the two-stop strategy with Nico would have been advantageous, especially given his pace in the closing stages. This is something we will review as we continue learning and improving.\n“One consistent positive has been the performance and spirit of the pit crew, who, again, delivered solid performance in the pit lane. The progress this team has made this year is significant and provides us with real momentum heading into 2026.\n“And finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Peter Sauber for his remarkable legacy and for shaping the team we are so proud to represent. As we move toward becoming the Audi Formula 1 Team in 2026, we do so with optimism, determination, and a clear sense of purpose.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Gabriel Bortoleto of Brazil driving the (5) Kick Sauber C45 Ferrari leads Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Kick Sauber C45 Ferrari on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Albon started on the soft tyre from towards the back of the grid, two-stopping his way to the flag. But a five-second time penalty for speeding in the pit lane did not help his cause out there. As for Sainz , he manged to one-stop on the medium and hard tyre combination, running out of rubber late on to fight his way any further forward.\nAlex Albon, 16th\n\"Firstly, I’m very happy for Lando and his Championship win. He’s taken a big step forward this year, risen to the pressure and his title is well-deserved.\n\"For us, it was a tricky race today. We had a great start, but we were never in a place where we had the tyre advantage, which meant we were stuck in a bit of a train.\n\"The last few races have been tough, but overall, it’s been a great season for us. I’m proud of the team and proud to finish top of the midfield. There’s no big secret behind it; just hard work, good leadership from James, and building some strong foundations. We’ve come a long way this season, and we’re heading into 2026 with a lot of optimism and a great mentality. I’m confident we can do great things next year, so I’m already excited to get back on track in 2026!\"\nCarlos Sainz, 13th\n\"We haven’t been strong all weekend and today was a normal race with not much going on. We committed to a one-stop strategy and got stuck in a train of DRS, so there was little to do from there with the pace we had.\n\"More importantly, looking at the season as a whole, it’s one to be proud of! I’ve stuck to my way of doing things, improved progressively throughout the year together with the team and, overall, we finished in good form. Fifth in the Constructors’ Championship was an ambitious target, and we got it, so I’m incredibly happy.\n\"We need to stay hungry and continue to push all together. We have built solid foundations for next year but there is always margin for improvement. Thanks to the entire team for their effort and to every single one of our fans out there, your support means everything to us!\n\"Last but not least, a massive congratulations to Lando on his first Drivers’ Championship! He’s an incredible driver and he has proven that you can achieve your highest goals staying true to yourself! Congrats my muppet friend! Well deserved!\"\nJames Vowles, Team Principal\n\"First and foremost, congratulations to Lando on a well-deserved Championship. For us, this marks the end of a really successful 2025. In a couple of days, we'll be testing here in Abu Dhabi in preparation for 2026 and, in just a few weeks' time, the 2026 car will be a reality and I can't wait. This is a good moment to say thank you to everyone that has been behind us for not just this year but for many years. It's the start of our journey and I can't wait for what's next. Thank you very much.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Carlos Sainz of Spain and Williams on the grid during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Lawson was penalised for erratic driving and earned himself a five-second time penalty for his troubles. With neither car scoring, Racing Bulls just held onto P6 in the championship by three points.\nIsack Hadjar, 17th\n\"It was a very tough Sunday. We haven’t had enough pace the whole weekend to fight for our usual positions, and yesterday it was a surprise for me to put the car in P9. We started in the points, but we knew it would have been difficult for us to maintain that place. Looking at the positives and reflecting on my first F1 season, it’s been a great journey and I’m proud of everyone within VCARB for everything we achieved together. It’s not the final race we wanted but getting P6 in the Constructors’ Championship was our target and a great reward for all of us.”\nLiam Lawson, 18th\n“Congratulations to the team on P6 in the Constructors'. While we struggled with our strategy and pace today, we've had a strong season and achieved our target this weekend. I'm excited to get back to work after the short winter break. Next year will be a big opportunity with the team which I'm very excited and grateful for.\"\nAlan Permane, Team Principal\n“Today brings an end to a long season, but a really really great season for Racing Bulls. Sixth place in the Championship is amazing; we’ve only ever reached P6 once before, so it’s a huge achievement. It’s truly a testament to the commitment, passion and hard work within this team, both at the track and back at the factory. Each and every person can be really proud of themselves. There have been ups and downs all the way through and it really went down to the wire with Aston Martin but I’m incredibly happy.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Isack Hadjar of France driving the (6) Visa Cash App Racing Bulls VCARB 02 leads Carlos Sainz of Spain driving the (55) Williams FW47 Mercedes on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Starting from the back, both cars two-stopped as they tried to make progress up the field. But they have not had the pace here all weekend, and ultimately propped up the order. Gasly beat his team mate despite receiving a five-second time penalty for track limit infringements and having contact with the Kick Sauber of Hulkenberg, while Colapinto’s P20 meant the Argentine did not get a point on the board in 2025.\nPierre Gasly, 19th\n“It was not a great race to end the season and there really is not a lot to say other than we tried our best but our pace was just not enough to really challenge. Looking back at the year as a whole, as a team, we can still take a lot from the season. I have been really impressed with how the team has handled a tough year where we have not been competitive. Despite its challenges, everyone has given their all and shown a really great mentality which we can take forwards to next year, so thank you to everyone trackside, at Enstone and at Viry for all their efforts this year. We have a lot of belief in the 2026 project and I am definitely looking forward to a clean slate and a fresh start for everyone. Finally, congratulations to Lando [Norris] on winning the title. It was a close one with Max [Verstappen] and Oscar [Piastri] and any of them could have taken it. For it to be decided by just two points is great for Formula One, so well done to all three, Lando managed to get it done and it's a big moment for him. One day we hope to be in that position and we will continue to work hard to hopefully one day do just that.”\nFranco Colapinto, 20th\n“It was a long and difficult race and, ultimately, we lacked pace all weekend. It's been a tricky stretch of races, and we haven't had the results we were expecting. It has been a tough end to the year, but everyone has kept pushing to the very end. It's a year we'd like to put behind us but learn and come back stronger from. Thanks to the entire team for their efforts this year in difficult circumstances. There's still a few weeks to push at the factory and wrap things up before the holidays. After that, it will be time to rest and reset for what will be an important year for myself and the team. Finally, congratulations to Lando [Norris]. He's had a great year and is a deserving champion.”\nFlavio Briatore, Executive Advisor\n“Today's result probably summarises our season where the car has not been competitive enough. It has been a long and often tough season for everyone at the team. I know everyone is eager and motivated to put this campaign behind us and very much ready to push tirelessly to make the next one more of a success. Congratulations to McLaren and Lando Norris on winning both championships. Their level this year has been extraordinary and they have been the benchmark in Formula One this season. For now, the hard work doesn't stop as we look ahead to a better 2026.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A525 Renault  during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Mark Thompson/Getty Images)\nPirelli\nMario Isola, Motorsport Director\n“Congratulations to Lando Norris on winning his first drivers’ title. The battle went all the way to the final round of the season – which was one of the most closely-fought of the last few years thanks to the similarly competitive pace of the different teams. Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri certainly didn’t hold back today, giving us a thrilling final.\nIn terms of strategy, the majority of the teams opted for a one-stopper using the most consistent two compounds as we expected: in some cases, stretching the hard tyre stint for more than 40 laps.  Even though there was no graining on the hardest compound, there were still inevitably some signs of wear in the final laps.\nAmong the drivers choosing the alternative strategy, the newly crowned champion Lando Norris stands out. He went for a two-stopper, probably prompted by the extra pit stop for Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, using the two fresh sets of hard tyres that McLaren had saved in their build-up to the race.\nFerrari’s Lewis Hamilton also used a fresh set of tyres for his final stint, which in this case was the medium. This excellent choice allowed him to make up several places, underlining how close the two strategic options were, as shown by our simulations.\nPirelli’s job does not stop here: we will be back on track on Tuesday together with all the teams for a full test day, A total of 10 mule cars piloted by the race drivers will try out the new 2026 tyre range, while 10 young drivers will take to the track with this year’s cars and tyres.”"}

Running a solid second, he was the first car to pull into the pits when the Safety Car was called into action. Swapping to more mediums, the Dutchman found himself on the tail of Norris in third – but knowing the two cars ahead had to pit twice. As such, he inherited the lead when they came in, and again when the papaya cars pitted a second time. He never looked likely to be challenged for the lead, as he won his seventh Grand Prix of the season and jumped up to second in the Championship.\nTsunoda battled hard from the back of the field, and looked set to fall just short but Hadjar’s late puncture elevated the Japanese racer to P10.\nMax Verstappen, 1st\n\"I feel great, I am really proud of that one. We made the right call as a Team there to box: it was definitely what made us win the race today, as I felt like we were not on the same level as McLaren in terms of pace. When a safety car comes in it can shake up the grid and that was a great opportunity for us to then win the race. We did a very good job as a Team and I was very proud of us, especially as we nailed the strategy. In Abu Dhabi, we have nothing to lose and we are going to give it everything that we have. Of course, we are relying on another crazy race like we had today, but we are going in there with positive energy. We need to maximise the car and be as competitive as we can. We will stay focused, try and have a good time and hope that we start the weekend well.\"\nYuki Tsunoda, 10th\n\"I can be pretty satisfied with the weekend overall, a solid result in the Sprint and a point this evening. I tried my best to get into the points, and we got there in the end, it was a really tricky race tonight. The car felt good and the pace was okay, but the nature of the circuit and the two stop rule made it difficult. With the high speed corners and just one DRS zone, overtaking was nearly impossible and everyone struggled with it. Once the Safety Car came out, the strategy became fixed for almost everyone and that made it even trickier to make up positions. Over the last few races the Team have given me a strong car and I've been able to stay as close as I can to Max, so I'll look to do the same next weekend. It was impressive to see him secure another win and I will help him as much as I can in Abu Dhabi.\"\nLaurent Mekies, Team Principal\n\"We can definitely be happy with that one. The pace in the car steadily improved from Friday night when we were in a tricky position, to tonight when we could fight with the McLarens, which is a testament to the Team once again. Of course, the decisive moment was the call to come in under the Safety Car and it was another great call from our strategy team here and those working back in Milton Keynes. From there on, Max didn't put a foot wrong, drove two incredible stints, taking great care of his tyres and managed to create a solid gap to the McLarens, which drove us to this most welcome race win! Yuki managed to recover to score points and his pace was promising at the end of the race once outside of the DRS train. We'll need to perform again in Abu Dhabi and we will have absolute focus on getting the car into a position where Max can fight at the front and look ahead. What happens behind him is not something we can control.\"\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 30: Race winner Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates on arrival in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 30, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar. (Photo by Mark Sutton - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\nMcLaren\nPiastri made a great start from pole, leading on the first lap. Norris yielded to Verstappen into Turn 1, opting not to defend too hard from the dirty, inside line. Running first and third, McLaren were the only team not to pit under the Lap 7 Safety Car. While that promoted Norris back to second, it left Verstappen in third just a few seconds behind having already served one of the two mandatory pit stops. Piastri did everything he could to build a lead, but could not make up that time deficit and wound up coming home second when the pit stops did shake out. As for Norris, he could not even build enough of a gap to stay ahead of Sainz and Antonelli. After his second stop, he was fifth and stuck behind the Mercedes for lap after lap, only making it through on the penultimate lap when Antonelli made a mistake.\nAs such, Norris saw his Championship lead reduced to just 12 points over Verstappen, while Piastri dropped to third in the Championship, 16 points behind his team mate.\nLando Norris, 4th\n\"Frustrating result, we didn't get it right today, but hindsight is a wonderful thing. There was obviously the opportunity to finish higher, but we'll debrief as a team and come back stronger next week. We'll now ensure our focus switches to Abu Dhabi and do what we can to deliver the best possible result next weekend.\"\nOscar Piastri, 2nd\n\"We had the pace for the win today, we just didn't make the right call. I tried my best to catch Max, and we left it all out there, so it's painful not to get the win. Final push next week, I'll try and drive like I did this weekend and see what comes.\"\nAndrea Stella, Team Principal\n\"Today's race result is a huge disappointment; there's no point hiding it. We had the potential to win and to have both drivers on the podium, but we made an error of judgment during the Safety Car period and paid dearly for it. Today we had the fastest car, and the drivers did a great job, but as a team we didn't deliver for them. We will react to this setback as we always have, learning from our mistakes and working as a united and cohesive group. This is a team based on important values, and we will prove it once again.\n\"Now we must prepare ourselves in the best possible way for the final race. We still have every chance of achieving our goals. Let's not forget that we are still leading the Championship and both our drivers have a chance to win the title. It won't be easy, but we are channelling our disappointment into total determination.\"\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 30: Second placed Oscar Piastri of Australia and McLaren is interviewed during the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 30, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar.

The team then did a great job on his first pit stop under the Safety Car to jump him ahead of Antonelli. From there, the Spaniard put his foot down to keep within a pit stop window of Norris ahead – thus finding himself ahead of the McLaren when Norris finally pitted for his last stop. Despite some late car damage that saw his Williams begin to understeer, Sainz was able to hold on to P3 to bag his second podium of the season. As for Albon , he gambled on the hard tyre are the start but pitted behind the Safety Car and was able to run the preferred medium for the longer two stints. But he was held up in the pit lane with traffic, and thus could not make progress back to the points.\nAlex Albon, 11th\n\"Starting on the hards today, we were planning on trying to benefit from some clean air with those tyres, but the safety car happened early on and we had to pivot strategies. Having started on the hards we were out of position and had to finish the race on mediums which wasn’t ideal for our strategy. We maybe didn’t have the pace to get through all the cars in front, but I think we left something on the table as we had a good car today, as Carlos demonstrated as well. The team secured P5 in the Constructors’ Championship which is massive - a big, huge well done to everyone on the team as this was a big step forward for us this year and something that we should all be proud of.\"\nCarlos Sainz, 3rd\n\"Extremely happy! We had a very strong start and from there we executed a perfect race with strategy, tyre management, pit stops and communication. By the end of the second stint, I saw Piastri struggled to overtake me on fresh tyres, and at that moment I realised we had to go for the podium. I was pushing to the limit of the car but 6 laps to the end something suddenly broke! I started losing a lot of lap time in sectors 1 and 3 but I managed to keep it together and bring it home for P3!\n\"Today’s result is testament to the team’s hard work; I knew we were taking the right steps and, despite some difficult race weekends along the way, I had full confidence in what we are doing. I’m extremely proud of everyone, we deserve this P5 in the Constructor’s Championship, and I look forward to finishing the season on another high in Abu Dhabi! Let’s go!\"\nJames Vowles, Team Principal\n\"Exceptional. Really fantastic performance from Carlos and the team when it counted and every detail adds up. Getting on the podium by milliseconds really is such a just reward for the incredible work the whole team is putting in this year. I was proud of Carlos and the team when we got our first podium in Baku; the second is a dream come true, but perhaps more importantly at a track that was almost our worst last year. And we've come back, we've reinvented ourselves and the result is there for everyone to see.\n\"For Alex, we will come back fighting in Abu Dhabi. We haven't got it all together this weekend, but I'll reiterate that his performance across the season is why we've secured fifth in the constructors' championship today. And more so than that, his pace is still there. We just need to bring it all together.\n\"Finally, fifth would have been a dream come true just 12 months ago when we were languishing in ninth in the Constructors' Championship. Thank you very much.\"\n1 / 3\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 30: Third placed Carlos Sainz of Spain and Williams celebrates with his team in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 30, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar.

Russell dropped to seventh though, behind Sainz and Alonso. The team pitted both cars together, Antonelli losing out to Sainz in the first round of pit stops, while Russell likewise was held up by pit lane traffic. From there, Antonelli looked on for fourth, absorbing plenty of pressure from a fresher shod Norris behind but he made one late mistake which allowed the McLaren to slip through. As for Russell, he had a quieter race but inherited a place when Hadjar retired late on.\nGeorge Russell, 6th\n\"I lost several positions on the opening lap unfortunately and that compromised my race. The inside of the track, where I was starting from, is lower grip and that hurt me in the first few corners. I got caught out at turn two as I lost the rear and then I dropped another position at our first stop as we had to wait for the fast lane to clear. We battled back where we could, but we saw on Saturday just how difficult it is to overtake here. We had to be patient and, whilst P6 is not a result we came into the day hoping for, we’ve put a few more points on our tally in the battle for P2 in the Constructors’ Championship.\n\"We are well positioned to claim that P2 next weekend in Abu Dhabi. It is only between us and Red Bull Racing now so hopefully we can get the job done. We won’t just be looking to play it safe though. We want to end the season, and this era in our sport, on a high so we will be aiming to get ourselves on the podium.\"\nKimi Antonelli, 5th\n\"P5 is solid points today but we could have had much more. We were slightly unlucky at the first pitstop where we lost a position to the Williams of Carlos Sainz; we had a slower stop and had to hold as traffic passed us in the fast lane. That delayed us leaving the pit box and ultimately, that is what changed our race and denied us the chance to fight for the podium. We were stuck behind him for the rest of the afternoon, and it was impossible to attempt an overtake.\n\"I was pushing hard to stay ahead of Norris in the closing stages and unfortunately just pushed a little bit too hard. I got out of shape through turn nine and then had a massive snap of oversteer. I was lucky to save the car but sadly dropped the position to the McLaren. It was a frustrating and disappointing way to end what had been a good race up to that point. We will focus on Abu Dhabi now though and look to secure P2 in the Constructors’ with a strong performance to end my rookie season.\"\nToto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport\n\"We are frustrated with how our race played out today. It was a difficult evening where we could have brought home a podium at the very least, along with good points, but mistakes meant we didn’t take advantage of the situation.\n\"George had a tricky first lap, losing positions as he suffered from running on the lower grip side of the track. From there, the lap seven safety car meant we, along with almost the entire field, boxed and we were locked in strategically. It was the right call to box both cars but a slow stop with Kimi cost us a position to Sainz and that in turn held up George.\n\"It was almost impossible to follow closely and set up an overtake so we knew it would be a long race from there. Both drivers maintained pressure on those ahead though and were driving on the limit. We are fighting for P2 in the Constructors’ Championship and that is very important to us. Kimi was also pushing for his third podium in a row. Any view that he ‘let’ Norris past is hard to understand. It was a simple mistake and a frustrating one for both him and the team.\n\"We turn our attentions to Abu Dhabi and the final race of the season. We have a 33-point advantage over Red Bull so P2 is very much in our hands. We want to end the year and this era in F1 on a high and will be looking to do so in what is likely to be a spectacular championship-finale.\"\nAndrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director\n\"A really frustrating result for us today but we at least scored a decent number of points. We go into the last race 33 points ahead in P2 in the constructors’ championship and although we didn't have much clear air to show it, the car has good pace.\n\"George lost a bit of ground on the start but that seemed to be the case for all cars on the inside row. He then ended up off line following a snap at turn 2, lost grip with dirt on the tyres and unfortunately dropped places to Sainz and Alonso. Kimi's start was better and he was just settling into the stint behind Norris when the safety car came out at the exact lap that allowed the race to be completed with two 25-lap stints. As expected, almost all cars stopped; we ended up holding Kimi for slightly longer than necessary which cost him a place to Sainz and ultimately that is what cost him a shot at the podium. With George there was always going to be some loss from having to stack and that allowed Hadjar to also get in front. The rest of the race was fairly unspectacular. George gained a place to Hadjar when he had a puncture and also realised he could go a full second quicker once in clear air. Kimi lost a spot to Norris when he was pushing to stay ahead.\n\"Not the result we wanted but we will regroup over the next two days and hopefully finish the year strongly in Abu Dhabi.\"\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 30: Andrea Kimi Antonelli of Italy driving the (12) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W16 leads Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL39 Mercedes on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 30, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar.

He managed his tyres superbly, keeping everyone else at bay for lap after lap until he managed a spin all by himself. Fortunately that only cost him two places, and he came home seventh to extend Aston Martin’s lead over Haas in the Championship . As for Stroll , he pitted on Lap 7 like most of the field – but then came back in a few laps later. That guaranteed him a three-stop race, before he picked up a penalty for speeding in the pit lane. After four stops, the Canadian wound up retiring.\nFernando Alonso, 7th\n\"Two points yesterday and six today exceeds our expectations for this weekend. After the early Safety Car, we committed to the two-stop strategy along with everyone else. We didn't have the pace to fight ahead tonight. We got a bit lucky with the DRS train of cars and with how difficult it is to overtake here. We also got a bit lucky with the spin mid-race, because on another circuit maybe I would have ended up in the gravel. The points are a welcome boost in the battle in the Constructors' Championship as we head into Abu Dhabi.\"\nLance Stroll, DNF\n\"We started from P18 today and finished P17. It was always going to be challenging gaining back positions at this track so we tried something different with our strategy today and undercut so that we could have the opportunity to make up ground later in the race in case of another Safety Car, which sadly never came. We look to Abu Dhabi now in a week's time and hope we can be more competitive there.\"\nMike Krack, Chief Trackside Officer\n\"A strong race for Fernando this evening with six points helping strengthen our hold on seventh place in the Constructors' Championship. The early Safety Car dictated the strategy for the majority of the grid and limited our options. Fernando followed the conventional strategy and brought the car home in P7. With Lance, we suffered a radio issue, limiting our ability to speak with him, but we tried something different with an offset strategy in the hope that we might capitalise on a late Safety Car. Well done to the team here on the ground and back in the UK for their continued hard work and efforts.

Hamilton gained off the line by comparison, after opting for the aggressive strategy of a soft tyre start. The Monegasque driver then inherited a few places when Hulkenberg and Gasly clashed, and again when Hadjar dropped out late on. But eighth is scant reward from a difficult weekend. As for Hamilton, he climbed up to 12th but could go no further after finding himself stuck in a long DRS train.\nCharles Leclerc, 8th\n\"It’s been a really difficult weekend for us.

We struggled to run the cars with the very high tyre pressures mandated here and we clearly took a step backwards. A couple of races ago we were on the podium and today we were fighting for P10. For sure, it’s been tough. Next week in Abu Dhabi we can expect to be back to the more normal pressures, so we can hope for a better weekend. I can perfectly understand the frustration that everyone, the drivers, the mechanics, the engineers, is feeling tonight and we are sorry for our fans. But right from tomorrow morning, we will react as a team, we will be back at work trying to prepare as well as we can for Abu Dhabi.\"\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 30: Sparks fly behind Charles Leclerc of Monaco driving the (16) Scuderia Ferrari SF-25 on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 30, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar.

He managed to get Russell in the pit stops, and then found himself ahead of Alonso when the Spaniard spun. Thus, he was on for a very decent P6 finish until a very late puncture with just two laps to go ended both his quest for points and ultimately his race. His late retirement did promote his team mate into the top 10 though, Lawson having a relatively clean race and staying out of trouble in the DRS train behind Alonso for much of the evening.\nIsack Hadjar, DNF\n“It was just a very frustrating end of the race. When there were 10 laps left, I started to see the front left endplate vibrating a lot, so I tried my best to avoid the kerbs. Unfortunately, it broke, causing a puncture in the tyre and damaging the car, which led me to retire. It’s a shame as we lost out on many points today, and after a difficult start which I’ll review together with the team, it would have been a very good reward for us as a team after fighting for P6 for the whole race. We take the positives from this weekend in Qatar, where we showed good speed and bring them to next week in Abu Dhabi for the last race of the season.\"\nLiam Lawson, 9th\n\"It's positive to come away from the race with points after where we started. We had really strong pace when we were in clean air, but then spent the majority of the race in traffic. It's a shame to not have both cars in the points today after the damage Isack experienced towards the end, however I'm looking forward to closing out the season in Abu Dhabi while we fight for our position in the Constructors'.”\nAlan Permane, Team Principal\n“First of all, we apologise to Isack for the failure on his car. The front wheel deflector broke which we think is likely a consequence of the heavy kerbing here. Nevertheless, it shouldn’t do that, and we will investigate how it happened. Up to that point, it was an incredibly strong race, we were in for 6th place and racing well. Liam also had a very strong race; from 12th to 9th, finishing in the points and showing really good pace throughout the race. We go to Abu Dhabi with a job to do still, but I’m confident we’ll have the performance and can round off the season on a high.”\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 30: Liam Lawson of New Zealand driving the (30) Visa Cash App Racing Bulls VCARB 02 on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 30, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar.

He soon found himself passing Leclerc, and starting to hunt down Gasly before attempting to make a move on the Frenchman around the outside, but the two made contact and Hulkenberg spun off into retirement with a rear tyre puncture. As for Bortoleto, he had to serve his five-place grid drop here but managed to recover to P13 on a night where there were not too many opportunities with the majority of the field pitting at the same time.\nNico Hulkenberg, DNF\n\"It’s such a big shame to have a promising race end so early, after being hit by Pierre [Gasly], as I genuinely think we could have scored points today. I felt confident with the car yesterday and the pace was there in the first seven laps. Overtaking opportunities here are very limited, so I went for a manoeuvre around the outside, which is always a bit riskier, but I gave Pierre plenty of space. It’s very unfortunate, as there were definitely opportunities for us today. For now it’s only disappointment, but we’ll take a couple of days to refocus and try to finish our season in Abu Dhabi in the best possible way.”\nGabriel Bortoleto, 13th\n“It wasn’t the most exciting race for me: there weren’t many overtakes, and I spent most of it being stuck behind Lewis [Hamilton]. Once he pulled a gap, I couldn’t really close it again, so my race just kind of stayed there from that point on. I had some battles at the start, but after that not much happened. There’s still something we can take from the weekend, and a few things we could’ve improved. The penalty from Las Vegas obviously affected my race today, but our pace itself was encouraging. If we’d started around P14, we might have had a shot at the top ten. Overall, there are definitely some good learnings to carry forward into the last race of the season in Abu Dhabi next week.”\nJonathan Wheatley, Team Principal\n“Unfortunately, it was a tough day in the office for the team. After strong opening laps, Nico was caught in a racing incident at Turn 1, which ended his race early. Gabi delivered an impressive performance, starting from P19 and fighting through to P13 with strong pace throughout. The pit crew were outstanding once again, delivering two very quick and clean stops.\n“Given our speed and where our competitors finished, a strong points result was within reach, so it is disappointing not to have converted that potential. Now we turn our focus to Abu Dhabi, the final race of an exciting season, determined to finish strong.”\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 30: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany and Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber walks away from his damaged car after a crash during the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 30, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar. (Photo by Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty Images)\nAlpine\nGasly was running in the top 10 early on but collided with Hulkenberg as the soft-shod German tried to overtake. That dropped Gasly down to last as he limped around before pitting with the field under the resultant Safety Car, and from there carrying some car damage, he had a long evening. Colapinto started on the hard tyre from the pit lane after making changes to his set-up overnight, but did not manage to progress too far up the order.\nPierre Gasly, 16th\n“Today's result is a real pity as we definitely would have been in contention for scoring points after lining up in ninth place. I was really looking forward to the race with the potential we had after improving performance of the car yesterday. We had some damage after running wide at Turn 14 and then Nico [Hülkenberg], on Soft tyres, put a lot of pressure on for a few laps. I held my line into Turn 1, we were side by side and then he made contact with my front left while making the overtake. That was pretty much our race over with a puncture and it was always going to be difficult to recover from there with quite a bit of damage to the car. Next week we look ahead to the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi. We will try to repeat our performance here and put ourselves in contention for points.”\nFranco Colapinto, 14th\n“We knew starting from the Pit Lane, and with the maximum tyre stints for this race, that most teams would run similar strategies and there would be fewer variables to give us opportunities to make progress. So, there wasn't really much we could do, or many cards up our sleeves to play with. It made for a long and lonely evening, even if we did manage to make up a few places and stick on the back of the cars in front. The car felt better with the set-up changes we made, but ultimately, we lacked the pace and strategy options to attack. I was disappointed with myself yesterday but today was a better day, however I generally struggled for grip and sliding particularly in the final part of the race. There's lots to take away from the weekend with the team testing a few things. Now we're looking ahead to the final race in Abu Dhabi and trying to end the season on a positive note as a team.”\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 30: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Kick Sauber C45 Ferrari and Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A525 Renault battle for track position during the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 30, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar.

But something went wrong down at Haas, with Bearman seemingly released early with the rear jack still attached. As well as damaging his car and costing him time, that earned him a 10-second stop/go penalty for the car being released in an unsafe condition. After serving the penalty, Bearman retired from the race. As for Ocon , he was the third car not to pit immediately under the Safety Car. The team brought him in next time around, which dropped him from third to last. And from there, he could not recover - especially given he picked up a time penalty for a false start to boot.\nEsteban Ocon, 15th\n“I don’t really have words for the penalty, I don’t know where that’s come from. I’ve done over 100 starts and have always done the same procedure. It killed our whole race, and then we had to serve a double penalty, and then being on the wrong tyre, that was the end of our race really. The next race will be an important one, last year the team had a lot of pace, so we’ll see what we get.”\nOliver Bearman, DNF\n“It’s a shame, as we were on for a good result, getting lucky with the incident ahead of us. We had the pace to be there though, and we were fighting in the top 10. Now we’ve lost some points against competitors, which is a shame, but we have one more race to go to do our best and claw it all back. I’ve got to look at the positives, and although the car was tough to drive, we found ourselves in a point-scoring position. I’m looking forward to resetting and ending the season on a high.”\nAyao Komatsu, Team Principal\n“It’s been an extremely tough day. It had good potential, the pace in the car was good, and both drivers were much happier with the car. It’s a shame with Esteban, there was the smallest of movements from his car on the start grid, which we need to understand more about. We made a couple of big errors on the pit stops, we’re not proud of it, but when doing 24 races and however many pit stops we do – we all make mistakes. What’s important is that we stick together and support each other. We have one more race, an important one, next weekend, and it’s a good thing as we’ll get back up from this one and put on our best performance from FP1 through to the race. We’re determined to finish the season on a high, that’s our focus.”\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 30: Oliver Bearman of Great Britain driving the (87) Haas F1 VF-25 Ferrari makes a pitstop during the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 30, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar. (Photo by Peter Fox/Getty Images)\nPirelli\nMario Isola, Motorsport Director\n“All the strategic choices in today’s race were conditioned by the arrival of the safety car. The compound considered to be the best compromise between getting good grip right from the start, and also maintaining an adequate performance level throughout the duration of the stint, was the medium.\nAlthough nearly every driver only used the hard for the final stint to the flag, the C1 compound would also have been competitive halfway through the race. The lap times showed that in some cases it offered better performance than the C2 medium in the final laps. All the compounds displayed very limited wear, allowing drivers to push to the maximum.\nThere was a lot less graining compared to previous days, which reduced cases of extreme wear but did not eliminate them entirely. As a result, the 25-lap limit was shown to be appropriate to avoid any issues.\nThe fascinating twists and turns of this race, with unprecedented levels of performance and new circuit records set throughout the weekend, reflect an entire season with closer competition than ever. So it’s perhaps no surprise that the championship now gets decided at the last race, with three very worthy contenders going into battle for the final time next weekend.”"}

He did everything he could to reduce the Championship lead that his team mate enjoys, and in the end took two points out of Norris, who came home third. Norris had to work hard at the start after briefly challenging Russell for P2, and then had to defend with Verstappen behind having DRS in the early stages. But third place was more than enough to keep the Championship firmly in his own grasp.\nWhen it came to Qualifying, the two team mates slugged it out all the way to the last laps of Q3. Norris grabbed provisional pole on the first runs, but was a spectator on the second runs after a mistake forced him to abandon at Turn 2. Piastri nailed his last lap to steal pole back, as McLaren locked out the front row.\nLando Norris, Sprint: 3rd, Qualifying: 2nd, 1:19.495\n“Sprint and Quali done here in Qatar. The Sprint wasn't the most eventful, but it was useful ahead of tomorrow's Grand Prix.\n\"The front row is a good starting position for tomorrow's race. We saw in the Sprint how difficult it can be to overtake here, but with a longer race and some more strategy options, we'll see what we can do to fight for the win. We'll work this evening to prepare for the race and make sure we're in the best possible position for tomorrow's Grand Prix.\"\nOscar Piastri, Sprint: 1st, Qualifying: 1st, 1:19.387\n\"A great result to be on Pole and to have won the Sprint. I've been able to get comfortable in the car really easily here and the pace has been mega. Driving around here in these conditions is some of the most fun you can have in an F1 car, so it seems to have all clicked well. However, the big points are in the main race, so let's see what we can do tomorrow. Just got to keep focused, do what we can overnight and make sure we finish first.\"\nAndrea Stella, Team Principal\n\"A very positive day for the team, with a first and third place in the Sprint and a one-two finish in Qualifying. Oscar was perfect today, it would be difficult to ask him to do a better job, and it was great to hear him so happy on his in-lap after Pole position. Lando didn't have perfect balance in the Sprint and in Qualifying a small mistake in his last attempt in Q3 cost him the chance to fight for Pole right to the end, but once again another strong effort and he’ll be on the front row of the starting grid.\n\"There is still a lot of work to do to prepare for the race and we have no intention of making calculations, especially because our main opponent will be right behind us, ready to take his chances. As always, we will focus on ourselves to maximise our starting positions.\"\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 29: Sprint winner Oscar Piastri of Australia and McLaren celebrates in parc ferme during the Sprint ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 29, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar. (Photo by Peter Fox/Getty Images)\nMercedes\nRussell had to get his elbows out at the start, aggressively moving across the track to ensure Norris did not slip past. From there, he could not keep up with Piastri, but did well to stay ahead of Norris and hold onto second place. Antonelli also scored, as the teenager managed to sneak past Alonso when the Spaniard ran wide. But he was handed a five-second time penalty for track limit infringements and was fortunate to hold onto sixth.\nCome Qualifying, both cars made it to Q3. Russell went for the double warm-up tactic, but just did not have the pace to fight for higher than fourth, as he was ably backed up by his team mate in fifth.\nGeorge Russell, Sprint: 2nd, Qualifying: 4th, 1:19.662\n\"We can be pleased to be starting P4 tomorrow; it’s a good place to be on the grid and gives us a solid opportunity to score strong points in our battle for P2 in the Constructors’ Championship. Obviously, being so close to P3 with such a small margin of just one hundredth between us and Verstappen is annoying, but the field is so close right now. Both McLarens were fast throughout and did an impressive job so I think P3 was the maximum we could have hoped for. Overall, we did a good job as a team with Kimi in P5, and we will be looking to secure P2 in the standings tomorrow.\n\"Tomorrow’s race will be interesting with the tyre stint limit making it a mandatory two-stop race. The car balance has felt good this weekend so I’m hopeful that we can be in the race for the podium. We are looking forward and let’s see what the points situation is once the chequered flag falls.\"\nKimi Antonelli, Sprint: 6th, Qualifying: 5th, 1:19.846\n\"I am not fully satisfied with P5 today as I know we had a little bit more pace to show. That said, it is still a solid place to be starting tomorrow's race from and gives us a good chance of banking a decent number of points.\n\"My final lap in qualifying wasn’t perfect. I had a strong second sector but struggled more than the rest of the weekend to hook up the first sector. I lost the rear a little bit at turn one and that caused me to lose some momentum. That always makes it a little more difficult to recover the lost time through the rest of the lap. That was disappointing, however, we improved our performance considerably compared to yesterday’s sessions and I am sure we will be able to maximise the potential of the car tomorrow. Strategically, it should be a straightforward two-stop. The start, just like it did in today’s Sprint, is likely going to play a huge role in the outcome of the race, so that is where I need to gain as many positions as possible.\"\nToto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport\n\"That was a solid, if not spectacular, Saturday in Qatar. Coming into the weekend, our focus has been on continuing to score good points as we try to secure P2 in the Constructors’ Championship ahead of the final race of the season. P2 with George in the Sprint plus Kimi bringing home a further three points has helped us extend our advantage slightly. A decent qualifying session, with the cars in P4 and P5, gives us a good opportunity to seal our place in the standings on Sunday.\n\"We aren’t getting ahead of ourselves though. The field is incredibly competitive with just one tenth of a second the difference between multiple places in qualifying today. We also saw how difficult it was to overtake in the Sprint so making sure we’re in a strong position after lap one tomorrow will be key. McLaren are clearly the reference this weekend, but we are within striking distance. It will be interesting to see how the strategy plays out with the mandatory stint lengths too. We will race hard, be looking to challenge for the podium, and hopefully do the job we need to in order to close out P2.\"\nAndrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director\n\"That was another solid day in Qatar. In the Sprint, George didn't get off the line brilliantly but did well to hold position. Kimi had a decent start but couldn’t quite turn that into a gain of positions. Overtaking is challenging here so we knew that we would likely be looking to bank our positions from there. George did a good job to do that and pick up a Sprint podium whilst Kimi did well to pressure Alonso into a mistake. Unfortunately, he picked up a five0second penalty for track limits which without that would have given him P5; P6 was still useful points though.\n\"We didn't change the car much going into qualifying; it's always a bit of a balance between chasing more performance with setup changes and ending up with a car that the drivers find less compliant. This evening’s session ran smoothly but both drivers felt that they could have found a bit of time and been starting higher up the grid tomorrow; there were no glaring errors though and realistically McLaren were out of reach today. We scored useful points in the Sprint and have a good chance of adding to that tomorrow. If we can do so, we can be confident of sewing up P2 in the Constructors’ ahead of Abu Dhabi.\"\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 29: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W16 leads Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL39 Mercedes on track during the Sprint ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 29, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar. (Photo by Clive Rose - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\nRed Bull\nBoth Verstappen and Tsunoda had strong starts, and both picked Alonso off the line. Tsunoda then yielded to his team mate, which allowed Verstappen to charge after Norris. The Dutchman had DRS for lap after lap, but eventually had to give up the fight as his tyres ran out of life in the dirty air. As for Tsunoda, he was handed a track limit penalty and had five-seconds added to his race time. Fortunately, Antonelli behind did likewise, so Tsunoda did not lose any places at the flag.\nBut the Japanese driver’s strong weekend did not continue as he exited Qualifying at the first time of asking. Verstappen made Q3 in a car that finally looked more balanced, but he did not have the pace to fight with the McLarens for pole tonight. He starts third, knowing he has to finish ahead of Norris to keep his Championship charge going.\nMax Verstappen, Sprint: 4th, Qualifying: 3rd, 1:19.651\n“It was a tough start to the weekend with the Sprint as we were not entirely happy with the behaviour of the car. We were a bit off the pace and, although we got a good start, there was still a bit of work to do with the car. In Qualifying, the performance of the car was better; there were a few limitations, including understeer, which this track can highlight, but we still maximised our performance. Before the session, we changed a few things with the car and make the most out of it with our prep. Overall, I’m pretty happy with P3 and we will see what we can do in the race. Hopefully we can have a strong day tomorrow and you never know what can happen around here, there are a lot of medium speed corners which we can tend to struggle with, but it will also be about looking after our tyres. The two-stop strategy can work for you or against you, but we will find out tomorrow. On race day, the most important thing will be to try and have a good start. We might struggle to stay with the McLarens, but you never know what can happen, we will try everything that we can.\"\nYuki Tsunoda, Sprint: 5th, Qualifying: 16th, 1:20.761\n\"Today was a mixed day, the Sprint was good for me and then Qualifying didn’t follow the same pattern. I got a good start in the Sprint, I could have maybe taken more risks but I wanted to keep the car safe. Max also got a good start and as a Team we were able to make it work and I could help Max out. I nearly lost out with the time penalty but I felt like I had a strong Sprint, with good pace. I don’t understand what then happened in Qualifying, we didn’t change much in the car, but I just didn’t have much grip and felt like I had lost the pace. My lap felt pretty tidy, probably tidier than yesterday, so I can’t fully explain what was different from Sprint Qualifying, it is very frustrating. I will do my best tomorrow and try to use the pace I had in the Sprint to overtake as much as possible.\"\nLaurent Mekies, Team Principal\n“We managed to recover a little from Friday in the Sprint, as Max did well to make up positions on a track on which it is tricky to pass. It was positive on Yuki's side too, he managed his best finish with the Team and carried on his good work from Sprint Qualifying. The Team, Max, and Yuki have never given up in the search for performance, and we had a fairly unpleasant car at times over the weekend. Everyone on track and back at base kept working to find the improvements and while we've not quite reached the pace of the McLarens, the gap has closed a little in Qualifying this evening. For Yuki, it was tough out there, he was only three tenths off Max, which on a track like this is nothing to be ashamed of and on any other day it would have been a strong session for him. Heading into the race tomorrow there is the mandatory two-stop in the race here, which could produce some surprises, and we will be ready to take any opportunity coming our way.”\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 29: Fourth placed Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing is interviewed during the Sprint ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 29, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar.

He then ran sixth for much of the race, but found tyre wear quite high and slid wide at one point which allowed Antonelli through. In the end he held onto seventh, and those two points were enough to lift Aston Martin ahead of Haas in the Championship. As for Stroll, he started on tyres that were seven laps old and thus had to pit. He bolted on the softs, so gained some crucial information ahead of Qualifying.\nAlonso’s strong weekend continued apace as he made Q3 in Qualifying, but he could not quite match his P4 from yesterday. Eighth on the grid is still a very promising slot for tomorrow though. Stroll once again could not match the Spaniard, exiting at the first time of asking.\nFernando Alonso, Sprint: 7th, Qualifying: 8th, 1:20.418\n\"I was quite surprised we were able to fight for Q3 again tonight and I'm happy with P8. We only had four sets of new Softs in Qualifying, so we opted to use them in Q1 and Q2 and it meant we were left with used tyres at the end in Q3.  We scored two points earlier in the Sprint, but I think it will be more difficult for us tomorrow as the tyre degradation is quite high. Every point is crucial at the moment for the Constructors', so we will give it our all.\"\nLance Stroll, Sprint: 19th, Qualifying: 19th, 1:21.058\n\"A frustrating day today qualifying in P19. I feel like I'm on the limit with the grip that I have and can't find any more pace. I felt pretty good in the car, but the lap time is just not coming together for me here and I didn't manage to go any quicker than that. It will be tricky tomorrow to fight back any positions as it's hard to overtake at this track, but we'll see what chances we get.\"\nMike Krack, Chief Trackside Officer\n\"It was good to score a couple of points in the Sprint earlier today with Fernando in P7 – an important result as we close out the season. Fernando carried this momentum into Qualifying ending the session in P8. He enjoys this track and the car has been more competitive here. Lance delivered clean laps but was not able to progress into Q2. Let's see what happens tomorrow. It's usually a track position race – with everybody mandated to stop twice – but we will be ready to capitalise on any opportunity.\"\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 29: Fernando Alonso of Spain driving the (14) Aston Martin F1 Team AMR25 Mercedes on track during the Sprint ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 29, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar.

That was despite a chunk of his bodywork falling off midway through the race, which could easily have cost him lap time. Albon was slightly unlucky, he finished 10th and was within touching distance of Hadjar ahead, but ran out of time to try and make a move.\nSainz made the top 10 again in Qualifying, but came a cropper in Q3 when he found himself on an out-lap with some material caught around his rear tyre. That damaged the side of his car, so all things considered, seventh on the grid is a great result. Albon faded in Qualifying, managing just P15.\nAlex Albon, Sprint: 10th, Qualifying: 15th, 1:20.629\n\"We made some balance and setup changes after the Sprint and the car felt better in qualifying which is a positive takeaway. Ultimately, we just didn’t have the grip today; I was sliding around a bit and struggled to get the tyres in the right window in Q2. We found that we had decent grip with used sets in Q1, so we’ll review the operating windows and our out laps to better understand performance. Overtaking was difficult on this track in the Sprint, with it being a quiet race with not much action from my side. As a team this track wasn’t expected to suit us, but I’m optimistic for tomorrow and we’ll see what we can do during the race to make up some positions.\"\nCarlos Sainz, Sprint: 8th, Qualifying: 7th, 1:20.287\n\"Another good session and happy with P7. We took another step in the right direction and I think I extracted the maximum out of the car today. In Q3, the sticker on the floor of the garage stuck to my wheel and caused damage to the bodywork as it unravelled, but despite this I still managed to do a solid lap on the last attempt and secure a good starting position for tomorrow.\n\"We expect a good battle in the midfield and with two mandatory pit stops we are up for some interesting strategies. I’m confident we can execute a good race and hopefully bring more points for the team. Let’s race!\"\nJames Vowles, Team Principal\n\"If anyone had said before the weekend that we'd be fighting in Q3 and qualifying in the top seven, we would have taken it. Well done to Carlos, brilliant execution, and well done to the team. It was really tricky getting the tyres into the right window today, but P7 was a brilliant result. It puts Carlos on the clean side of the grid and bodes well for tomorrow's race. In the case of Alex, it was just on a knife edge with everyone getting the tyres working, and we just couldn't get into the right window. He had snaps in turn one every time and couldn't show his performance today. We'll regroup overnight and review how we can create the best opportunities for him in the race tomorrow. He's still quick, it's just about maximising the opportunities.\"\n1 / 3\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 29: Carlos Sainz of Spain driving the (55) Williams FW47 Mercedes leads Isack Hadjar of France driving the (6) Visa Cash App Racing Bulls VCARB 02 on track during the Sprint ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 29, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar.

Hadjar made a great start and ran ninth, showing that the car does have top-10 potential this weekend after a disappointing Sprint Qualifying. But Lawson struggled, and had to give a place back to Leclerc after only managing to get the Ferrari man by running off track.\nHadjar made up for his SQ2 exit yesterday by making it to the top-10 in Qualifying, grabbing sixth on the grid as the best midfield runner out there. Lawson did not make Q3 this time around, but is not out of contention in P12.\nIsack Hadjar, Sprint: 9th, Qualifying: 6th, 1:20.114\n\"We had a pretty good Saturday and I’m happy with the performance we showed. This afternoon in the Sprint I had an awesome first lap, and if I hadn’t lost the position during a battle with Kimi and Carlos, then I would have probably been able to score a point. Later in Qualifying, I think we really extracted the maximum from the car as we couldn’t have finished higher up in the standings; P6 was really our best today. I felt the car was easy to drive and I reached the limit pretty quickly in the session, then from there I just made tiny steps lap by lap. Looking at tomorrow, it’s going to be important to have a good start even if we start from the wrong side of the grid. I expect it to be a full push race and the target is to score points.”\nLiam Lawson, Sprint: 14th, Qualifying: 12th, 1:20.433\n\"The car has been very sensitive this weekend but it felt in a much better window compared to yesterday, meaning we ended Q1 in a good place. Unfortunately, very small changes make the car feel tricky to drive, so we barely improved in Q2. It's frustrating, but a step up from yesterday given our race pace was very good when the balance was there. We'll come together to make improvements ahead of the race tomorrow.”\nTim Goss, Chief Technical Officer\n“A really good day for VCARB today in Qatar. Both drivers had good starts, good opening laps and gained places in the Sprint. Isack was briefly ahead of Sainz and into a points scoring position, but slipped back after attempting an overtake on Antonelli. He made up two places from his starting position and finished 9th. Liam had a great opening lap and settled in just behind Leclerc, gaining a total of three places to finish 14th. Overall we were pleased to make places and to show our car's race pace which was strong ahead of tomorrow. Qualifying was an exciting session. We knew both drivers had more to deliver than Sprint Qualifying and we proved it. Both drivers progressed through Q1 comfortably and retained new tyre sets for the later sessions. Q2 was extremely tight, and Liam just missed the cut into Q3. Isack progressed and ultimately delivered two fantastic laps to qualify an impressive 6th. Both drivers are well placed against our main competitors in the Constructor’s Championship and we look forwards to bagging some vital points in the race tomorrow.”\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 29: Isack Hadjar of France driving the (6) Visa Cash App Racing Bulls VCARB 02 heads to the grid prior to the Sprint ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 29, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar.

Bortoleto finished ahead of his team mate though, as he picked up a couple of places in the 19-lap dash and Hulkenberg lost a couple. Come Qualifying, both cars made Q2 which was good considering Bortoleto has a five-place grid drop to take.\nBut he wound up 14th, and thus drops to the last row of the grid tomorrow. Therefore, any chance of points falls to Hulkenberg, who is handily placed in P11.\nNico Hulkenberg, Sprint: 16th, Qualifying: 11th, 1:20.353\n\"It was a clean qualifying session for us: I’m relatively happy with the laps and the effort we put in, although it’s frustrating to miss out on Q3 for just three thousandths of a second. The margins were incredibly fine and that time was probably out there somewhere. Still, we are on the edge of the top ten and we have an extra set of soft tyres for tomorrow’s race: we’ve seen this morning, in the Sprint, how difficult overtaking can be, but we are competitive and we’re around cars we can fight.”\nGabriel Bortoleto, Sprint: 11th, Qualifying: 14th, 1:20.534\n“The Sprint went quite okay for us. I gained two positions at the start, had a solid launch, and the pace felt decent, so I was pretty satisfied with that. Qualifying was a bit more challenging: I pushed a little too hard, ran slightly wide, and that was enough to cost me the lap. The rest of it wasn’t too bad, but it definitely wasn’t ideal. Tomorrow I’ll be starting P19 with the penalty from Las Vegas, so it won’t be an easy job. It’s a long race though, and we’ll take what we learned today and try to move forward up the grid.”\nJonathan Wheatley, Team Principal\n“While today’s Sprint was rather uneventful for us, seeing Gabi finishing in P11 after making up two positions at the start, and Nico in P16, Qualifying was much more positive. I was particularly pleased with how the pitwall executed throughout the session, placing the cars in the right windows in traffic and managing the run plans cleanly. We had an encouraging start with both cars moving comfortably into Q2. Nico delivered very clean laps and missed out on Q3 by only 0.003 seconds, finishing P11. Gabi didn’t quite manage to perfectly execute his laps, and with the five-place grid penalty he carries from Las Vegas, he will start the race from P19.\n“There is still everything to play for tomorrow. We need to finish ahead of our main competitors in what is a very tight battle in the Constructors’ Championship, and with limitations on tyre life, it might be an interesting race.”\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 29: Gabriel Bortoleto of Brazil driving the (5) Kick Sauber C45 Ferrari leads Oliver Bearman of Great Britain driving the (87) Haas F1 VF-25 Ferrari on track during the Sprint ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 29, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar.

They did not have the pace to fight for the points, but will hope to have learned enough to challenge tomorrow in the Grand Prix. But the bad news for the American outfit is that once again Alonso is in the top 10, and once again neither Haas car is. Thus, they are up against it to try and retake that P7 slot tomorrow in the Grand Prix.\nEsteban Ocon, Sprint: 15th, Qualifying: 17th, 1:20.864\n“It was a difficult Sprint. The start was good, but after that, we picked up a lot of degradation and we couldn’t really keep up with the car in front, and being in traffic didn’t help. We tried to push things to the extreme in terms of set-up for qualifying, we really gave it our best go. It’s something we’ve never done as much to fix it, but we still have the underlying issue where we can’t put more front wing into the car, it’s still very loose on entry, and I still struggle to brake. I hope there’s going to be high degradation in the race, and if that’s the case, we can come back through the field and benefit from others, but at the moment, that’s our only hope.”\nOliver Bearman, Sprint: 12th, Qualifying: 13th, 1:20.438\n“The Sprint was quite uneventful – the race was difficult with the balance that I had. I was struggling quite a lot, and that was getting worse as I went on, so for the last few laps I was really hanging on. We’ve learned a lot from this race, so we get to fix things for the race tomorrow. Yesterday, we were very uncompetitive in high-speed, so that’s really what we need to fix. We made a big step with the car for qualifying, which is positive, I had a much better feeling than I did this time yesterday. Unfortunately, in Q2 I think we chose the wrong approach, I went for two laps at the end, where in hindsight I think the peak of the tyre was in that first lap, but I was carrying the extra fuel of the run plan I was doing, so it’s fine margins. I’m going to remain open-minded and positive, we made a big step with the car, so I’ll look forward to tomorrow.”\nAyao Komatsu, Team Principal\n“In the Sprint, limitations were actually quite different from what we anticipated from yesterday’s Sprint Quali. It also gave us a good indication on what we needed to do for our qualifying set-up. Some areas were better, but there are other problems we still couldn’t solve, hence we’re still losing lap time in high-speed. It’s a shame to miss out on Q3 with Ollie, I don’t think we got the finer details right with tire usage on Q2. When the field is so tight, we have to get everything right. Tomorrow, we need to see how we make use of our pace, which I think is better than our qualifying position, but it won’t be easy.”\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 29: Oliver Bearman of Great Britain driving the (87) Haas F1 VF-25 Ferrari on track during the Sprint ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 29, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar.

That left him in the midst of the midfield fights, and although he got close to Bearman, he could not find a way through. The car looked difficult again , with Leclerc running wide on occasion. Hamilton had opted for a pit lane start after changing his downforce levels, but that did not pay dividends, and he was unable to make any progress from the back of the field.\nHamilton’s day did not improve in Qualifying, as he exited in Q1 to make that two races in a row where he has dropped out at the first time of asking. Leclerc made Q3, but only had used tyres in the shootout. He then had a massive spin for good measure, managing just P10 in the end.\nCharles Leclerc, Sprint: 10th, Qualifying: 3rd, 1:20.561\n\"We gave it our all. This weekend has been very tough so far. We just don’t have the pace needed in the car on this type of track and were struggling to put in good laps in qualifying.\nWe can’t hide our disappointment. I don’t have big expectations for tomorrow, but I’ll try to reset and will do my best as always to bring home a good result for the team.\"\nLewis Hamilton, Sprint: 18th, Qualifying: 13th, 1:20.907\n\"P18 is a disappointing result and doesn’t reflect the hard work the team has put in over the last two days. Clearly this track doesn’t seem to suit our car and we’re still working to identify a set-up that meets its needs. We’ll keep pushing, analyse the data tonight, and look for every opportunity to put ourselves back in the points tomorrow.\"\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 29: Thirteenth placed Charles Leclerc of Monaco and Scuderia Ferrari is interviewed during the Sprint ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 29, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar.

They then pitted both cars late on for the soft tyres, to gain some experience on the C3 rubber. What they did clearly paid dividends on Gasly’s side of the garage as the Frenchman made it to Q3 for the 10th time this season. He is well placed to fight for points tomorrow in P9.\nPierre Gasly, Sprint: 18th, Qualifying: 9th, 1:20.477\n“I am very happy to be in Q3 for the tenth time this season. The team did a very good job today to make changes to the car, which felt a lot better and I was much more confident behind the wheel. We used the Sprint as a mini Practice session to try and understand a few things and make the necessary changes. The car felt much nicer to drive in Qualifying and we were able to put in a lot of good laps. After yesterday, I certainly did not think Q3 would be possible, so it just goes to show everyone's hard work and motivation within the team to find the right improvements. We will take the positives when we can and now we look forward to tomorrow's race. It is a mandatory two-stop for everyone with the limit on laps per tyre set. We saw today in the Sprint how hard it is to overtake here. We will need a good start, really fight for it, and hopefully we will be in the top ten at the end.”\nFranco Colapinto, Sprint: 20th, Qualifying: 20th, 1:21.137\n“It was not the best day on my side of the garage, particularly with how I drove today and my own performance. We made some positive improvements with the car between sessions, and it was just poor execution from my side. There was definitely more in the car and we didn't make the most of it today. For the Sprint, we decided to make some changes to the set up and used the session as a test. It was good to learn a few things and make some positive changes. The car immediately felt better on the first lap in Q1 but unfortunately, I ran wide into the gravel on the exit of Turn 15. I also made a mistake on my second push lap again running into the gravel on the exit kerb. Then we put everything on the final lap and we didn't do enough to progress. Overall, it was a messy session and one we take on the chin and quickly move on from.”\nSteve Nielsen, Managing Director\n“It has been an interesting past 24 hours where we have been able to completely transform our prospects for this race weekend courtesy of a lot of hard work and good decision making within the team. We decided to compromise our Sprint Race by changing the set up on both cars, meaning a Pit Lane start, in order to find improvements ahead of Qualifying, which clearly has worked. On Franco's side, while the car felt better, he probably knows he left some lap time on the table and we will continue to work with him in order to do a better job next time. Pierre has put himself in a great position for tomorrow's race where he will start in ninth place. He was really dialled in and put in some fantastic laps. We know we have the 25-lap limit per tyre set tomorrow so it will be interesting to see what teams decide to do on strategy and we will do our best to put ourselves in a competitive position to score points.”\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 29: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A525 Renault heads to the grid prior to the Sprint ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 29, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar. (Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images)\nPirelli\nMario Isola, Motorsport Director\n“The only difference in tyre choice for the sprint race was new or used mediums, depending on the results from sprint qualifying – as the few drivers not to get through SQ1 were able to use new tyres. Three drivers also made a pit stop in the sprint race to try out the soft tyres, probably to assess their potential use in Sunday’s grand prix.\n\"Just as was the case last year, we saw some tyres where graining had accelerated wear: taking it to the maximum but without any loss of performance. These instances, noted mainly on the front-left tyres, are exactly why the limit of 25 laps on each set has been imposed.\n\"The considerably faster lap times compared not only to last year but also the latest simulations has led to a bigger increase in loads on the tyres than expected. As a precaution, we already prescribed an increase in minimum pressures of 1 psi on both axles at the end of Friday.\n\"We saw some more cuts on some of the tyre treads during Saturday, but fewer than Friday. The two pit stops expected on Sunday should mitigate this issue. Looking ahead to the race, the sets of mediums kept back by the teams lead to the conclusion that most could go for two stints on the yellow tyre. The fastest strategy is with a final stint on the soft, following a pit stop between laps 44-50. The use of the hard C1 at the beginning, or alternatively between two medium C2 stints, would allow the pit stops to be spread out more evenly during the race – but this is theoretically slower than a strategy that uses all three available compounds.\n\"Medium-hard-soft is the second-quickest tactic on paper, with pit stop windows that are identical to the fastest strategy: between laps 19-25 and 46-50, in accordance with the lap limit. If there are no safety cars, we believe that the teams are likely to maximise the 25 laps allowed for each set.\n\"Another strategy using all three compounds could be hard-medium-soft, with a shorter final stint to the flag. In short, there are plenty of options on the table.”"}

Norris seemed to just have the edge at the start of Sprint Qualifying, but not by much. But once the mediums came off and the softs went on, Piastri was the man to nail his lap when it mattered. He even admitted to leaving some time out there after a hairy moment in Turn 4, but he did enough to beat Norris. In fact, his team mate is not even on the front row after Norris made a mistake on his first flying run, then lost his second to track limits after being hampered by starting the lap too close to Albon’s Williams.\nLando Norris, 3rd, 1:20.285\n“A frustrating Sprint Qualifying session. The pace was there, but I didn’t get a proper chance to show it. I made a mistake on the first lap, and my second lap was compromised when Alex [Albon] got ahead. We’ll see what we can do from P3 tomorrow, as always, we’ll go out and fight for the win. It can be tricky to pass here, but that’s exactly what I’ll try to do.\"\nOscar Piastri, 1st, 1:20.055\n\"A great start to the weekend. The car felt very good throughout all of Sprint Qualifying, so thank you to the team. The pace has been there all day, so it was good to be able to put it together. We’ll review overnight to see what we can do to make sure we finish at the front in the Sprint tomorrow and set ourselves up properly for Qualifying.\"\nAndrea Stella, Team Principal\n\"The weekend got off to a good start, with Oscar starting from Pole position in the Sprint and Lando in third position. The most important thing is that the car has proven to be fast on this track, and we know where we can still improve performance.

As such, his form was a little unknown going into Sprint Qualifying. But Russell looked strong throughout, even though Mercedes seemed to need a double warm-up lap on the medium tyres. He wound up grabbing second on the grid, between the two McLaren cars and inserting himself right into the midst of the Championship fight. Antonelli is a few places back, as he seemed to need a little longer to get to grips with the circuit.\nGeorge Russell, 2nd, 1:20.087\n\"I am very happy with how today went. I’ve been enjoying these past few qualifying sessions a lot, pushing the car to its limit and having it respond in the way that I want it to. That has enabled us to make the most out of the package we have and bag some strong results. Today was no different. P2 is a great result and to split the McLarens isn’t something we thought we would do ahead of the session.\n\"It’s going to be difficult to overtake in tomorrow’s Sprint so the race could potentially be decided coming out of the first corner. Starting on the front-row obviously helps and we will be aiming to score good points, even if we can’t fight for the win. The track here is really enjoyable, with a helpful high grip surface, so I’m looking forward to the rest of the weekend.\"\nKimi Antonelli, 7th, 1:20.532\n\"Qualifying P7 for tomorrow’s Sprint isn’t where we want to be starting. It is a tricky track and I made a few mistakes, particularly in SQ2 where I was fortunate to progress to SQ3 with the deleted lap time for Hadjar. Those moments cost me a bit of confidence and set me back a little bit for SQ3. Without that, there was definitely more pace to be found, and we could have been starting further forward in the field.\n\"It is a high grip circuit and the car balance felt good throughout practice and Sprint Qualifying. It was a shame not to maximise the potential of the car. Tomorrow is a new day though; we will analyse all the data overnight and have a look at my driving as well to understand how to improve and make the most out of the car. There is still a good chance of scoring decent points in the Sprint before the all-important qualifying session for Sunday’s race later in the evening.\"\nAndrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director\n\"It’s been a bit of a challenge getting the car into a decent window on the various tyre compounds today. We had solid pace on the Hard tyre at the start of FP1 and the long run looked competitive, but when we jumped to the Soft compound for some low fuel work, the grip wasn’t there, and we finished the session in P10 and P14. With so little data from just one practice session, it’s always a tricky decision whether to focus on the setup or the tyres. We decided to change both which is a bit of a risk on a Sprint weekend, although it did seem that our single lap pace had improved. George was relatively happy with the car by SQ3.\n\"We can’t seem to match McLaren in the high speed but for the rest of the lap we are competitive. Kimi felt that the car was good but underestimated the grip and was left wishing he’d pushed a bit harder. It wouldn’t have taken much for him to make it onto the second row but it’s encouraging for qualifying tomorrow evening if there is a bit more to come. The Sprint tomorrow will hopefully deliver useful learning and it’s a good opportunity to add a few more points.\"\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 28: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W16 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 28, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar.

He was fast in practice, fast throughout Sprint Qualifying and fast when it mattered, getting the beating of both Red Bulls. He is well placed to score, which is just as well as Aston Martin are one point behind Haas in the fight for P7 in the Championship.

The team tried to make some changes before Sprint Qualifying, but they did not appease the Dutchman who still lacked pace, especially on the soft compound tyre. He had to abort his first run in SQ3 after going wide, and could not extract enough pace on his second to factor at the front. All of which led to Tsunoda out-qualifying his team mate for the first time this season, albeit by just 0.009s.\nMax Verstappen, 6th, 1:20.528\n“Today wasn’t great for us, from the first stint we just had really bad bouncing and aggressive understeer. This would also shift into oversteer in the high speed, which is not what you need to go faster and when you are locked in. Of course, we tried to change a few things on the wheel but it never really worked so that made it quite tricky. We made some other changes after FP1 but it didn’t make too much difference in Sprint Qualifying so that is something we need to understand. Tomorrow in the Sprint, with this balance, it will not be a lot of fun and we will need to make some changes going into Qualifying.\"\nYuki Tsunoda, 5th, 1:20.519\n“So far it has been a clean weekend for me and pretty smooth, there had been no major issues in FP1 and that gave me more confidence going into Sprint Qualifying. It is good that it’s been uneventful so far! We have to put it all together, there are three more sessions to go and these are especially important to the Team and Max, both sides of the garage are very focussed and we are all giving our maximum. I am happy with the car but there is still some work to do ahead of tomorrow to find those extra tenths but I am excited.\"\nHannah Schmitz, Principal Strategy Engineer\n\"FP1 was a useful practice session for us, we were able to do some good high-fuel running which was helpful ahead of the Sprint tomorrow and the race on Sunday. We also were able to take a look at the Soft tyre on low-fuel which will be beneficial. Sprint Quali, unfortunately, didn't go the way we hoped it would have, so that's something we can learn from for the rest of the weekend. We've got another Qualifying tomorrow to make amends and I think we can still have a positive Sprint. Having the 25-lap enforcement will shake things up a little on Sunday, as ordinarily you'd want to follow a one-stop here, but it will be interesting to see how each team interprets the ruling.\"\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 28: Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing walks in parc ferme during Sprint Qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 28, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar.

Both drivers made it to SQ3 with ease, with Sainz getting the beating of his team mate to the tune of a couple of tenths of a second. They will be targeting points in the Sprint, especially given their closest rivals Racing Bulls did not manage to get a car into the top 10.\nAlex Albon, 10th, 1:20.788\n\"Alex Albon: It’s been a better start to the weekend than we thought it would be. We aren’t the quickest car out there, but we are in a decent position after only having one practice session today before Sprint qualifying.

We have a decent car heading into the Sprint and qualifying, so we’ll look to maximise all our opportunities tomorrow.\"\nCarlos Sainz, 8th, 1:20.542\n\"It’s been a very positive day for us at a track where, on paper, we could have struggled. We chose an experimental set-up which we haven’t tried yet this year, and it seems to have paid off, so I’m happy with that. It’s encouraging to see both cars in SQ3 and, as usual, our car felt stronger on the harder compounds.

Making the top 10 in Sprint Qualifying looked a tough ask, but Hamilton could not even make it out of the first segment, falling early as he did in Qualifying in Las Vegas. He radioed to say the car would not go quicker, as he seemed bereft of ideas.

But despite impressing at the start of Sprint Qualifying, he lost his final lap time in SQ2 to track limits and found himself eliminated in disappointing fashion. Lawson had already exited in SQ1 after a tricky day. He damaged his floor in FP1 after running wide over the kerbs, and never looked quite on the pace of his team mate.\nIsack Hadjar, 11th, 1:21.433\n“It was a frustrating Sprint Qualifying. I was doing a good lap but then got track limits in Turn 8, which is a shame as the car has been pretty fast today since FP1. Looking at tomorrow’s Sprint, I expect it to be a bit of a DRS train race, and therefore it will be difficult to make up some ground and score points. We’ll take the positives from today ahead of the main Qualifying.”\nLiam Lawson, 17th, 1:21.851\n“We struggled with balance a lot today. After FP1, we had to make quite a big step and ended up compromising a lap. It's tough with how close it is at the moment as I would've liked one more lap, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. It will be a learning ahead of the Sprint Race and Qualifying tomorrow, and we'll try to move forward as much as possible.\"\nMattia Spini, Chief Race Engineer\n“Historically this venue has challenged us, but the preparation work carried out was strong. FP1 showed a high lap time evolution as usual, but higher overall grip than expected. Isack showed competitive pace, while Liam struggled more with balance and was unable to complete his second push lap on the Soft compound. For Sprint Qualifying, our priority was achieving the correct balance for the lower track temperatures and the Medium tyre, while planning the optimal run structure to extract the most from the tyres and the evolving track. Liam continued to face car handling difficulties and unfortunately, did not progress to SQ2. Isack demonstrated solid pace, but his key SQ2 lap was deleted for track limits, leaving us to start from P11. That lap would have secured SQ3. As always, we will work to maximise every opportunity and target the strongest possible outcome.”\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 28: Isack Hadjar of France driving the (6) Visa Cash App Racing Bulls VCARB 02 in the Pitlane during Sprint Qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 28, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar. (Photo by Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty Images)\nHaas\nHaas are embroiled in a tight fight with Aston Martin in the Championship, but saw their rivals get one car into the top 10 in Qatar. The American team could not follow suit, with Bearman their lead driver in P12. Points are not out of the question from there, but it will take quite the start from the youngster if he wants to challenge for the top eight tomorrow.\nEsteban Ocon, 15th, 1:21.666\n“It was a difficult session, really. We just can’t get the car to go around the track properly, and it’s very difficult for us in high-speed parts, there’s instability, and we have understeer in the low-speed corners. It makes things tricky as we can’t add front wing at the moment, so we suffer in both types of corners, and that’s where the lap time is unfortunately. We made a lot of changes between the sessions today, which improved things, but overall there are still some things that we can do better.”\nOliver Bearman, 12th, 1:21.494\n“I think tyre wear is a little bit less of a factor than in previous years. As tracks age, they get rougher and this year with the tyres we have, it’s a simpler warm up. Unfortunately, on my final lap, I was behind a driver who kept going off, so I had a lot of gravel on track, which is mainly an issue of the circuit. A lot of us have said that gravel being at that corner isn’t the best way to solve issues because we then have it everywhere, damaging tyres and ruining laps. I also had traffic in sector three, so it was the perfect storm. I think it’s going to be very hard to overtake on this track as there’s only one DRS zone and a short one at that. The target will be to learn as much as possible before qualifying tomorrow. I feel we have a quicker car than what we showed just now, so I’m happy about that, I’m just a bit disappointed with this qualifying.”\nAyao Komatsu, Team Principal\n“I think we did a good job improving the car between sessions, and both drivers were much happier with the balance, so that’s pleasing to see how much improvement we can make. In SQ1, operationally it was very good, but in SQ2, not so much and it’s all about tiny margins, that’s what matters. We’ve learned quite a lot today, so for the Sprint we'll learn as much as possible so we can set the car up more competitively for Sunday’s race.”\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 28: Oliver Bearman of Great Britain driving the (87) Haas F1 VF-25 Ferrari on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 28, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar. (Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images)\nKick Sauber\nBortoleto is carrying a grid drop from Las Vegas, which will be applied to Sunday’s Grand Prix. As such, he was free to qualify today. Both cars looked quick in SQ1 and even seemed in the mix for the top 10, but they faded in SQ2 as others began to turn up the wick. The Brazilian out-qualified his team mate though, which Hulkenberg will want to do something about over one lap tomorrow. The German was left a little frustrated after going slower in SQ2 than he managed in SQ1.\nNico Hulkenberg, 14th, 1:21.631\n\"I felt quite happy with the car, the track was grippy and I made it through SQ1 comfortably. I was on a good final lap in SQ2 but had some oversteer at the final corner and ended up going wide: looking at the data, it might have been enough to make it to SQ3. We’ll do our best in the Sprint, but the main focus is on qualifying: there will be changes to the cars and the order can be reshuffled a bit.”\nGabriel Bortoleto, 13th, 1:21.567\n“I think we did quite okay today, though I feel like we could have squeezed something more out of our car. I didn’t have much grip in the first push in SQ2, and after a quick stop in the pits for some fine-tuning, the second run felt better. It’s obviously a bit disappointing to miss SQ3 by just a tenth and a half, but that’s how close it is out there. Looking at tomorrow’s Sprint, we know overtaking here won’t be easy. We’ll keep pushing, aim for a clean Sprint, and then move forward to deliver a clean Qualifying as well.\"\nJonathan Wheatley, Team Principal\n“Overall, it was an encouraging start to Sprint Qualifying. Both cars progressed through SQ1 cleanly, and we felt optimistic about reaching SQ3. Nico was definitely on course to make it, but running wide at the final corner on his last timed lap ultimately cost him. Up to that point, the lap looked very strong.\n“For Gabi, the balance on his first run wasn’t where he needed it to be. We made an adjustment for the second attempt, but he wasn’t quite able to string the lap together. While we didn’t advance as far as we hoped, we have clear areas to build on for the upcoming sessions.”\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 28: Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Kick Sauber C45 Ferrari on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 28, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar. (Photo by Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty Images)\nAlpine\nGasly ran wide in practice, kicking up dirt and gravel in his wake as he struggled to get the best from his car. Colapinto was not faring much better, and Sprint Qualifying always looked a tough ask for the team. So it proved, with the two Alpine drivers grabbing slots on the back row of the grid. Gasly out-qualified his team mate, but their Sprint looks set to be more of a test run for the Grand Prix than anything else from there.\nPierre Gasly, 19th, 1:22.112\n“It was a tough Sprint Qualifying for us today and a disappointing end result. On my final lap in SQ1, I just struggled right away at Turn 1 with cold tyres and the grip was just not there opening the lap and we lost a lot of time. After that, the tyres picked up in temperature and Sectors 2 and 3 were much better but the damage was already done from the very start of the lap. It would have been tight to reach SQ2 - we were maybe not quite quick enough today - but at least we have something to learn from and hopefully we can improve for tomorrow's Qualifying.”\nFranco Colapinto, 20th, 1:22.364\n“Looking at the result from Sprint Qualifying, it clearly isn't where we wanted to be and not the best outcome. I felt we were quite competitive straight out of the blocks in FP1, and we didn't look too bad on the Hard tyres. I didn't do a representative lap on the Softs, as we had a big snap and lost a lot of time. With the gravel traps being so close to the exit of the corners here, any mistake or running wide gets punished and you risk damaging the floor, which we did during practice and impacted our preparations a bit. There's definitely some things we need to analyse and consider for the remainder of the weekend and test a few things. The car felt trickier to drive in the evening session in particular and we will look at what we can do to change that tomorrow.”\n1 / 2\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - NOVEMBER 28: Pierre Gasly of France and Alpine F1 checks the timing sheet during Sprint Qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Qatar at Lusail International Circuit on November 28, 2025 in Lusail City, Qatar. (Photo by Mark Sutton - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\nPirelli\nSimone Berra, Chief Engineer\n“Today we definitely had better track conditions compared to last year, when the wind had deposited a lot of sand on the surface, which affected grip considerably. The current grip levels, combined with the evolution of the cars since last year, meant that the lap times were not only lower than the equivalent sessions from last year, but also than the simulations.\n\"In the single free practice session, teams chose to get to grips with the track using the hard compound – leaving them with one set for the race on Sunday – before concluding the session on the soft.\n\"The difference between the soft tyre and the C2 medium was clearly seen in sprint qualifying, with a performance gap of around six to seven tenths of a second, while the run plans that the teams were carrying out in FP1 make it harder to define the gap to the hard compound. However, it would appear to be smaller than the predicted simulations.\n\"On their flying qualifying laps the drivers were able to recover performance from one lap to the next, especially on the medium tyre, thanks also to track evolution that was more pronounced with every lap.\n\"At the end of the sessions, we saw cuts on the tread of some of the tyres caused by gravel pulled onto the circuit by cars that went off into the new gravel traps alongside the track. While the damage isn’t enough to cause any loss of pressure, we’re going to be a close eye on the condition of the tyres during tomorrow’s running.”"}

Of the top 10 finishers, only Fernando Alonso pitted twice. Just one driver ran the soft with the sole aim of setting the fastest race lap.\n“Graining and degradation were both limited and so, even those who pitted before half-distance managed to run just two stints with no difficulties.”\nFor more information about Pirelli’s F1 tyres, visit pirelli.com ."}

Before the campaign kicks off, here is the lowdown on the 22 drivers that will be lining up on the grid this year…\nLando Norris – McLaren\nA name that perhaps needs little introduction off the back of 2025, newly-crowned World Champion Lando Norris returns for his seventh season in Formula 1 with McLaren .\nAfter impressing during his junior career, Norris arrived in F1 back in 2019. His first podium followed in 2020, while he became a regular visitor to the rostrum in 2021. The Briton just missed out on a debut victory at Sochi that season, but his breakthrough win finally came at the 2024 Miami Grand Prix.\nFrom there Norris became Max Verstappen’s closest challenger for the championship – and while he had to settle for second on that occasion, the McLaren racer outscored his rivals to seal his maiden title in 2025.\nOscar Piastri – McLaren\nJoining Norris at McLaren in 2025 is Oscar Piastri , marking the pair’s fourth season as team mates at the papaya squad.\nFollowing a dispute over his services between McLaren and Alpine, Piastri made his F1 debut for the former in 2023, arriving with a notable record in the junior classes that saw him clinch the F3 and F2 championships on his debut in each category.\nThe Australian backed up that promise in the top echelon, taking a win in the Qatar Sprint in his maiden season before scoring two Grand Prix victories in 2024. After leading the World Championship for much of 2025 following an early winning streak, Piastri’s challenge faded in the latter stages – but he will be keen to make up for that in 2026.\nGeorge Russell – Mercedes\nLike Norris, George Russell made his F1 debut in 2019 – and, like Piastri, the Briton had won the F3 and F2 titles back-to-back on his first attempt, arriving with much promise as he joined Williams in Formula 1.\nRussell had to be patient during his three-year stint with the Grove-based outfit, the team often finding themselves near the back of the grid. His first points came amid a substitute appearance for Mercedes at the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix, where only a puncture and pit stop issue saw him miss out on a maiden win.\nFurther points and a podium followed with Williams in 2021, before his full-time switch to the Silver Arrows in 2022 delivered numerous rostrums and his first Grand Prix victory. Russell impressed as the team’s new leader in 2025, collecting two wins to help Mercedes climb up to second in the Teams’ Championship.\nKimi Antonelli – Mercedes\nKimi Antonelli will enter into his sophomore Formula 1 season in 2026, the Italian having endured various highs and lows during his rookie campaign.\nA rapid ascent through the motorsport ranks saw the youngster bypass F3 to make his F2 debut in 2024. Mercedes – having scouted Antonelli during his karting days – felt that the teenager had done enough to earn promotion to their F1 team in 2025.\nAntonelli’s maiden season was not without its tough moments, but a Sprint pole in Miami, three podiums and a strong end to the year ensured that he kept his spot at the Silver Arrows into 2026.\nMax Verstappen – Red Bull\nAnother driver to arrive into the sport off the back of a dazzling junior career, Max Verstappen became F1’s youngest-ever competitor when he made his debut as a 17-year-old for Toro Rosso back in 2015.\nThe Dutchman quickly impressed, claiming his maiden points in his second race before a promotion to Red Bull in 2016 brought a memorable first victory in Barcelona. Verstappen continued to hone his skills in the years that followed as he collected further wins.\nA legendary title fight with Lewis Hamilton in 2021 saw Verstappen become World Champion for the first time, the Red Bull driver going on to clinch three more consecutive championships. He ultimately missed out by a mere two points to Lando Norris in 2025 – but his remarkable resurgence following a trickier start to the season makes Verstappen as formidable an opponent as ever entering into 2026.\nIsack Hadjar – Red Bull\nThe other side of the Red Bull garage will look a little different in 2026, as Isack Hadjar prepares to race alongside Verstappen after being promoted from the sister Racing Bulls outfit.\nArriving into F1 as one of a batch of rookies in 2025, Hadjar’s season got off to a rocky start after spinning off on the formation lap of his debut race in Australia. The Frenchman soon recovered, though, and delivered on the promise he had displayed as a 2024 title challenger in Formula 2.\nHadjar scored his first points at Round 3 in Japan and from there continued to add to Racing Bulls’ tally, which included a maiden podium at Zandvoort. All of this was enough to earn the youngster a promotion to Red Bull in 2026, replacing Yuki Tsunoda as the Japanese racer moves to the role of test and reserve driver.\nCharles Leclerc – Ferrari\nIt will be season nine in F1 for Charles Leclerc in 2026, as well as marking the Monegasque’s eighth campaign with Ferrari .\nLike Piastri and Russell, Leclerc collected back-to-back titles in F3 and F2 before arriving in the top echelon with Sauber in 2018. Putting his car in the points on numerous occasions showcased his talent – and led to a seat at the Scuderia in 2019.\nLeclerc took two wins in his first season with the Italian team, and has since brought his tally up to eight. While Ferrari went without a victory in 2025, Leclerc and the squad will be hoping for better in 2026.\nLewis Hamilton – Ferrari\nIn a career that has so far spanned 19 seasons, Lewis Hamilton has rewritten the history books since his debut with McLaren in 2007.\nAfter claiming his maiden World Championship with the Woking-based outfit in 2008, Hamilton went on to experience a stunning run of success following his switch to Mercedes in 2013, with driver and team scoring multiple titles between 2014 and 2020.\nThe Briton made blockbuster headlines when he decided to join Ferrari in 2025 – and while his first campaign with the team was a challenging one, Hamilton will be keen to bounce back in 2026 and add to his glittering record in Formula 1 that has so far featured a historic 105 wins.\nAlex Albon – Williams\nAlex Albon joined Lando Norris and George Russell in stepping up from F2 to Formula 1 in 2019, the Thai driver making his debut for Toro Rosso. A solid start saw him earn a mid-season promotion to Red Bull, with whom he went on to score two podiums in 2020.\nWhile the Milton Keynes-based outfit replaced him with Sergio Perez for 2021, Albon was retained as a test and reserve driver and earned a return to the grid with Williams in 2022.\nIt was an opportunity that he seized, establishing himself as a team leader as the Grove-based outfit continued their ascent up the grid. Albon formed a strong line-up with new team mate Carlos Sainz in 2025, helping the team to achieve fifth place in the Teams’ Championship for the first time in eight years.\nCarlos Sainz – Williams\nCarlos Sainz will again join Albon at Williams in 2026, a year in which both will be hoping to build on a solid 2025 and progress even further up the grid.\nSainz arrived in F1 at Toro Rosso in 2015 alongside Max Verstappen and quickly showcased his talent. Spells with Renault and McLaren followed, with the latter seeing Sainz collect his first podiums in the sport.\nA move to Ferrari in 2021 brought further success, the Spaniard regularly finishing on the rostrum as well as claiming four wins. Since his switch to Williams in 2025, Sainz has continued to impress and twice put the squad back on the podium with two top-three finishes.\nLiam Lawson – Racing Bulls\nAfter collecting wins in F3 and F2, Liam Lawson was acting as a reserve driver for Red Bull and AlphaTauri when he was called up by the latter in 2023 to substitute for an injured Daniel Ricciardo across five races.\nThe New Zealander’s performances caught the eye, and he again returned to the grid to replace a struggling Ricciardo for the last six rounds of 2024. Another step up the ladder followed when Red Bull opted to promote him for 2025, placing the young driver alongside Max Verstappen.\nAmid two difficult weekends at the start of the season, Lawson was demoted back to Racing Bulls – but a solid remainder of the campaign was enough to ensure that he will remain with the team into 2026.\nArvid Lindblad – Racing Bulls\nA new face will arrive on the grid in 2026, as rookie Arvid Lindblad joins Racing Bulls for his maiden F1 outing.\nSuccess in karting saw Lindblad make the switch to single-seaters in 2022, going on to finish fourth in the 2024 F3 championship while he became the youngest race winner in F2 history when he embarked on his debut season in the category at 17 years old in 2025.\nHaving long been a member of the Red Bull Junior Team, Lindblad was given three FP1 runs for the team in 2025 – and it was announced days before the Abu Dhabi finale that the Briton will compete for the sister Racing Bulls outfit in 2026.\nFernando Alonso – Aston Martin\nAt the other end of the experience spectrum, Fernando Alonso will be embarking on his 23rd season in F1 in 2026, his fourth campaign with Aston Martin .\nAfter catching the eye during his debut for Minardi in 2001, Alonso went on to achieve back-to-back World Championships as a Renault driver in 2005 and 2006, while subsequent stints with McLaren and Ferrari brought his wins tally up to 32.\nFollowing a hiatus in 2019 and 2020, the Spaniard returned to Formula 1 in 2021 with Alpine before joining Aston Martin in 2023. While he enjoyed eight visits to the podium that season, Alonso has not visited the rostrum since – can he rectify that in 2026?\nLance Stroll – Aston Martin\nRemaining at Aston Martin alongside Alonso is Lance Stroll , marking the pair’s fourth season as team mates.\nStroll debuted for Williams back in 2017 aged 18 and memorably scored his first podium in Baku, making him the second youngest driver after Max Verstappen to stand on the rostrum. He moved to the then-named Racing Point outfit in 2019, with his father Lawrence having led a consortium that took over the team midway through 2018.\nThe Canadian has since continued to race for the squad – which became Aston Martin in 2021 – and will enter into his 10th campaign in the sport in 2026.\nEsteban Ocon – Haas\nAfter joining Haas in 2025, the 2026 season will mark Esteban Ocon ’s second with the team and his 10th in Formula 1.\nOcon made his debut partway through 2016 for the Manor team, before going on to join Force India. Replaced by Stroll for 2019, the Frenchman spent a year as a reserve driver for Mercedes and subsequently returned to the grid with Renault in 2020.\nAfter the squad became Alpine in 2021, Ocon scored his maiden win at the Hungarian Grand Prix. He went on to switch to Haas in 2025, pairing up with rookie Ollie Bearman.\nOllie Bearman – Haas\nThe 2026 season will see Ollie Bearman again race alongside Ocon at Haas, off the back of an impressive rookie campaign for the Briton.\nDuring his second year in F2 in 2024, Bearman was called up to replace an unwell Carlos Sainz at Ferrari in Jeddah. The youngster caught the eye after scoring points on his debut, while other substitute appearances followed for Haas later in the season.\nThis earned Bearman a full-time promotion with the American outfit in 2025, a season in which he scored a career-best P4 finish in Mexico. Can he build on that result even further in 2026?\nNico Hulkenberg – Audi\nWhile Kick Sauber will have a new name when they become Audi in 2026, the team’s line-up will stay the same, led by the veteran Nico Hulkenberg .\nAfter his debut for Williams in 2010, Hulkenberg went on to race for Force India, Sauber and Renault. The German found himself without a seat between 2020 and 2022, but some notable stand-in drives for Racing Point/Aston Martin during this time saw him make his return to the grid with Haas in 2023.\nHulkenberg has been in solid form ever since, switching to Kick Sauber in 2025 and clinching a long-awaited maiden podium at Silverstone on his 239th attempt.\nGabriel Bortoleto – Audi\nIt will be season two in F1 for Gabriel Bortoleto in 2026, the young Brazilian having made his mark in the junior categories before joining the top echelon.\nLike Leclerc, Russell and Piastri before him, Bortoleto triumphed in the Formula 3 and Formula 2 championships on his debut in each, leading to the youngster getting his F1 chance with Kick Sauber in 2025.\nWhile his rookie campaign was not without its tough moments, Bortoleto impressed his bosses with five points finishes and will continue to drive for the squad as they transition into Audi.\nPierre Gasly – Alpine\nPierre Gasly enters into his ninth full-time season in Formula 1 in 2026, the Frenchman continuing on with Alpine .\nGasly first arrived on the grid with Toro Rosso at the end of 2017, going on to race for the squad in 2018 before a call-up to Red Bull in 2019. His struggles to match Max Verstappen saw him demoted back to the sister outfit midway through the season – but Gasly quickly rebuilt, taking his first podium later that year in Brazil.\nThe highlight of Gasly’s career to date came at the 2020 Italian Grand Prix, where he scored a memorable victory for AlphaTauri. His move to Alpine in 2023 saw him reunite with old rival Esteban Ocon, with whom he shared a surprise podium at the 2024 Sao Paulo Grand Prix. While the team faced a challenging 2025, Gasly will be hoping for better in the year ahead.\nFranco Colapinto – Alpine\nAlpine will field an unchanged line-up in 2026, as Franco Colapinto continues on as Gasly’s team mate.\nA race winner in the junior categories, Colapinto joined the Williams Driver Academy in 2023 and was subsequently drafted in by the F1 team to replace Logan Sargeant during the final nine races of 2024, going on to finish in the points on two occasions.\nThe Argentinian joined Alpine as a reserve driver for 2025 and found himself back on the grid from Round 7 onwards, having stepped into the seat previously occupied by Jack Doohan. While he failed to score points, Colapinto did enough to earn another season at the squad in 2026.\nValtteri Bottas – Cadillac\nAn 11th team arrives on the grid in 2026 in the form of Cadillac – but while the American outfit might be new, their drivers are familiar names.\nValtteri Bottas will make his return to the grid, marking his 13th season in the sport. The Finn made his debut for Williams in 2013, claiming nine podiums for the team before his switch to Mercedes in 2017. This took his career to new heights, with Bottas winning 10 races and finishing second in the Drivers' Championship in 2019 and 2020.\nA three-year stint with Alfa Romeo/Kick Sauber followed between 2022 and 2024, but the Finnish driver returned to the Silver Arrows as a reserve after finding himself without a seat in 2025. Now he will return to action with Cadillac, marking a new challenge for the veteran racer.\nSergio Perez – Cadillac\nAnother experienced name lines up alongside Bottas at Cadillac in 2026, with Sergio Perez also making a comeback.\nIt was back in 2011 that Perez first competed in Formula 1 with Sauber, while stints with McLaren and Force India/Racing Point followed. The latter saw Perez grab a maiden victory at the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix.\nAfter being replaced by Sebastian Vettel for 2021, Perez was signed up by Red Bull, with whom he earned five more wins as well as helping the outfit to achieve two Teams’ Championship titles. A more difficult second half of 2024 saw him leave the grid, but in the summer of 2025 the Mexican was announced as a Cadillac driver."}

Here is the lowdown on the outfits that will be in action when the campaign kicks off…\nMcLaren\nReigning Teams’ Champions McLaren return for their 61st season in Formula 1, with Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri entering into a fourth campaign as team mates while Andrea Stella continues as Team Principal.\nThe Woking-based outfit are one of the most historic names in the sport. Founded by Bruce McLaren, the squad made their debut in 1966 and have since collected 203 wins, 13 Drivers’ Championships and 10 Teams’ Championships.\nMcLaren will be looking to continue their recent strong run of form into 2026, a year in which they will be aiming to score a third consecutive Teams’ crown for the first time since 1990, while Norris is preparing to defend his maiden Drivers’ title.\nMercedes\nAnother team with an impressive track record, Mercedes are fielding the unchanged line-up of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli in 2026. Toto Wolff remains at the head of the squad, a position he has held since 2013.\nAfter acquiring the former Brawn GP outfit in 2010, the Silver Arrows soon worked their way to the front of the pack, going on to seal a record eight consecutive Teams’ Championships between 2014 and 2021 as well as seven drivers’ titles, six of which belonged to Lewis Hamilton.\nWhile the team have not experienced quite the same level of success in recent years, their P2 in 2025 marked a promising upturn.\nRed Bull\nIt will be season number 22 for Red Bull in 2026, a campaign in which they will again have a new driver pairing.\nFollowing their run of consecutive championships with Sebastian Vettel from 2010 to 2013, Max Verstappen repeated this feat by claiming four Drivers’ titles between 2021 and 2024. The Dutchman lost out to McLaren’s Lando Norris in 2025, but can he fight back this time around?\nVerstappen will be joined by a new team mate in the form of Isack Hadjar , with the Frenchman making the step up from Racing Bulls to replace Yuki Tsunoda, while Laurent Mekies starts a campaign as the outfit’s Team Principal for the first time following his appointment last summer.\nFerrari\nA name that needs little introduction, Ferrari are the only team to have competed in every Formula 1 season since the championship began back in 1950.\nThe Scuderia have gone on to earn 15 Drivers’ Championships and 16 teams’ titles across the years, but their last were scored in 2007 and 2008 respectively.\nCharles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton continue on as the Italian outfit’s pairing with Fred Vasseur as Team Principal for 2026, a season in which the squad will be hoping for better after ending 2025 without a Grand Prix win and in fourth place of the Teams’ standings.\nWilliams\nWilliams return after a positive 2025 season, having claimed an assured P5 in the Teams’ Championship as well as scoring two podiums courtesy of Carlos Sainz .\nThe Grove-based outfit – led by James Vowles since 2023 – are no strangers to success, with seven drivers’ and nine teams’ titles to their name across their long history in Formula 1.\nTheir fortunes took a dip during the late 2010s, but Williams will be hoping that their strong outing last season – coupled with the solid line-up of Sainz and Alex Albon – helps them to take another step in 2026.\nRacing Bulls\nAnother team with a slightly different line-up for 2026 is Racing Bulls , as the Red Bull sister outfit prepare to field the only rookie amongst this year’s grid.\nAfter Red Bull’s acquisition of the former Minardi team in 2006, the squad has since run under the guises of Toro Rosso, AlphaTauri and RB before their transition into Racing Bulls in 2025, achieving two victories – courtesy of Sebastian Vettel and Pierre Gasly – along the way.\nThe incumbent Liam Lawson is joined by Arvid Lindblad in 2026, with the 18-year-old making the step up following a P6 finish in the 2025 Formula 2 Championship. Alan Permane , meanwhile, continues on as Team Principal following his promotion from Racing Director last summer.\nAston Martin\nAston Martin are another squad that will be hoping for progress in 2026, off the back of ending the 2025 season in seventh place.\nFortunes have varied for the former Racing Point team since taking on their current moniker in 2021, with the high of several podiums in 2023 followed by two tougher campaigns in the years since.\nFernando Alonso and Lance Stroll form an unchanged pairing in 2026, marking their fourth season as team mates, while the headline news in late 2025 was that Adrian Newey will become Team Principal for the next campaign.\nHaas\nF1’s newest team – prior to this year’s addition (more on which later) – Haas will embark on their 11th campaign in Formula 1 in 2026.\nAcross 214 Grands Prix so far, the American outfit’s best race finish to date has been a P4, a record held by Romain Grosjean that was equalled by Ollie Bearman at the 2025 Mexico City Grand Prix.\nBearman is joined by Esteban Ocon again this season, as Haas – headed by Team Principal Ayao Komatsu – look to build on the positives after ending the last campaign in eighth.\nAudi\nThe former Kick Sauber team will go under a different name in 2026 as the squad becomes Audi ’s works outfit, a transition that coincides with the new wave of technical regulations being introduced into the sport.\nNico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto move into their second season as team mates, following on from a year in which Hulkenberg memorably clinched a long-awaited debut podium at Silverstone. Jonathan Wheatley acts as Team Principal, having joined earlier last year.\nKick Sauber finished the 2025 Teams’ Championship in ninth – can they make progress under the Audi name in the campaign ahead?\nAlpine\nAlpine – formerly known as Renault – faced a tricky 2025 season, ending the year at the bottom of the standings with a sizeable points deficit to their rivals.\nThe squad have taken one victory and six podiums under the Alpine name, with two of the latter scored by Pierre Gasly who is set to embark on his fourth campaign with the team.\nGasly will again have Franco Colapinto as his team mate in a season that will mark a new era for the outfit in that they will no longer produce their own power units, instead switching to Mercedes engines. Steve Nielsen remains as Managing Director following his appointment in 2025.\nCadillac\nAn 11th team will join the grid in 2026 as Cadillac prepare for their maiden season in Formula 1, making them the first new squad since Haas debuted back in 2016.\nTeam Principal Graeme Lowdon has made no secret of the American outfit wanting experience in their driver line-up, with Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez each making a return to the grid following a year on the sidelines.\nWhile General Motors and TWG Motorsports are building a power unit facility that will make Cadillac a full-works operation in the future, Ferrari are set to supply the team’s engine and gearbox in 2026."}
{"title": "Who are the 2026 F1 Team Principals?", "summary": "Here are the 11 Team Principals preparing to lead their respective outfits into the 2026 F1 season.", "published_time": "2026-01-11T10:04:38.988Z", "url": "https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/who-are-the-2026-team-principals.2Jrw5LEJbEoX2gM5OtFL8K", "content": "Here are the 11 Team Principals preparing to lead their respective outfits into the 2026 F1 season.\nWith just weeks to go until the 2026 season begins, the Team Principal of each F1 squad will be busy preparing for the 24-race calendar ahead. Here is the lowdown on the 11 team bosses who will be heading their respective outfits’ charges into the campaign…\nAndrea Stella – McLaren\nAndrea Stella ’s promotion to Team Principal of McLaren in December 2022 came after a long career in the sport, which saw him first join Ferrari as a test team performance engineer in 2000. He later worked with Michael Schumacher on the race team from 2002 onwards, a championship-winning era for the squad.\nThe Italian transitioned to the role of race engineer for Kimi Raikkonen in 2009 before taking on the same position alongside Fernando Alonso for five years. Stella moved with the Spaniard to McLaren in 2015, becoming Head of Race Operations.\nFrom there he was promoted to Performance Director in 2018 and then Executive Director, Racing in 2019. Since taking on the Team Principal role in December 2022, Stella and McLaren have been on an upward trajectory which has seen them claim back-to-back Teams’ Championships in 2024 and 2025, as well as taking the Drivers’ crown with Lando Norris last season.\nToto Wolff – Mercedes\nNow the longest-serving current Team Principal on the grid, Toto Wolff has been at the helm of Mercedes since 2013. Following a brief racing career, Wolff switched his focus to the worlds of business and investments early on.\nIn 2009, the Austrian invested in the Williams F1 team and later became an Executive Director of the squad. He then became a Managing Partner at Mercedes in 2013, as well as acquiring a 30% stake in the outfit.\nWolff – who also acts as CEO of the team – headed the Silver Arrows during a hugely successful period in the years the followed, with the squad claiming both the Drivers’ and Teams’ Championships between 2014 and 2020 as well as earning the Teams’ crown in 2021. After climbing back up to P2 in 2025, Mercedes will be hoping to reach the very top again in 2026.\nLaurent Mekies – Red Bull\nFor the first time in the team’s history, Red Bull will start a season with a name other than Christian Horner as their Team Principal following the exit of the Briton last July, with Laurent Mekies since stepping into the role.\nMekies’ F1 journey began as an engine race engineer for Arrows in 2001 before joining Minardi in 2002, while he became Chief Engineer when the outfit transitioned into Toro Rosso in 2006 and later Head of Vehicle Performance. The Frenchman joined the FIA in 2014, taking on the roles of Safety Director and later F1 Deputy Race Director before being appointed Sporting Director at Ferrari in 2018.\nAfter progressing to Racing Director in 2021, Mekies parted ways with the Scuderia midway through 2023 as he prepared to move to the then-called AlphaTauri outfit as Team Principal in 2024. This was a role he remained in until getting the call-up to replace Horner at Red Bull midway through 2025, where he led the team through a resurgence in the second half of that campaign.\nFred Vasseur – Ferrari\nOver at Ferrari , Fred Vasseur will act as Team Principal for a fourth season in 2026, the Frenchman having taken on the role at the start of the 2023 campaign.\nPrior to arriving into Formula 1, Vasseur experienced success through running his own teams in the junior categories, having co-founded the championship-winning ART Grand Prix outfit with Nicolas Todt. He later became Team Principal of the Renault F1 team in 2016 before heading the Sauber/Alfa Romeo outfit between 2017 and 2022.\nDuring his time at Ferrari, Vasseur has been involved in one of the biggest driver moves in the sport’s history following the signing of Lewis Hamilton for 2025.\nJames Vowles – Williams\nAnother person who took the reigns at their team in 2023 is James Vowles , Team Principal of Williams . The Briton’s F1 career began as an engineer with BAR back in 2001, where he went on to progress through the ranks during the outfit’s guises as Honda, Brawn GP and Mercedes.\nVowles acted as Chief Strategist during Brawn GP’s championship-winning campaign in 2009, while he went on to experience further success across Mercedes’ run of titles between 2014 and 2021, having been promoted to Motorsport Strategy Director in 2019.\nSince joining Williams at the start of 2023, Vowles has led the Grove-based outfit through their continued mission to return to the top, claiming a ‘best of the race’ fifth place in the 2025 Teams’ Championship.\nAlan Permane – Racing Bulls\nThe Red Bull reshuffle midway through 2025 saw Alan Permane move to the role of Team Principal at Racing Bulls , marking the latest step in a lengthy career in the sport for the Briton.\nAfter completing an electronic engineering apprenticeship, Permane joined the then-called Benetton team in 1989. He would subsequently remain with the Enstone-based outfit through to 2023 across their various guises, progressing through the engineering ranks with roles including Race Engineer and ultimately Sporting Director.\nAmid organisational changes during the 2023 season, Permane exited the team before returning to F1 with Racing Bulls – then known as RB – for the 2024 campaign in the position of Racing Director. His promotion to Team Principal followed in 2025 in the wake of Mekies’ departure to Red Bull.\nAdrian Newey – Aston Martin\nA name that needs little introduction, Adrian Newey has carved out a reputation as one of the sport’s most famed and successful designers, with his creations for the likes of Williams, McLaren and Red Bull winning numerous championships.\nFollowing his stints with the two former teams, Newey joined Red Bull in 2006 for what would be his longest partnership with a squad, remaining with the Milton Keynes-based outfit until the news of his impending exit was announced in May 2024.\nAmid months of speculation over his next move, it was later confirmed that Newey would take on the role of Managing Technical Partner at Aston Martin in 2025 – and, amid an organisational restructure, it has since been announced that the Briton will also act as Team Principal of the outfit in 2026.\nAyao Komatsu – Haas\nAyao Komatsu enters into his third season as Team Principal of Haas in 2026, having worked his way up following his arrival in F1 as an engineer for the BAR outfit back in 2003.\nKomatsu went on to join Renault in 2006 as a performance engineer and subsequently a race engineer, working with drivers including Vitaly Petrov and Romain Grosjean. Like Grosjean, the Japanese engineer left for the newly-formed Haas team in 2016.\nAfter acting as Trackside Engineering Director for several years, Komatsu was promoted to the role of Team Principal following the exit of Guenther Steiner at the start of 2024, a season in which the outfit recovered to P7 in the championship.\nJonathan Wheatley – Audi\nOver at Audi , Jonathan Wheatley continues on as Team Principal following his arrival at the team – under its former guise as Kick Sauber – in April 2025.\nStarting out as a junior mechanic for Benetton in 1991, Wheatley rose to the role of Chief Mechanic during his time with the Enstone-based outfit, which was brought to an end when he joined Red Bull in 2006.\nTaking on the position of Sporting Director, the Briton was a part of the squad across numerous championship victories before his exit was announced in August 2024 as he prepared to become Team Principal of Kick Sauber in 2025. Wheatley will now lead the team into their first campaign as Audi following the manufacturer’s takeover of the outfit.\nSteve Nielsen/Flavio Briatore – Alpine\nFollowing the exit of former Alpine Team Principal Oliver Oakes in May 2025, Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore took over the duties previously covered by Oakes, while Steve Nielsen was later hired as Managing Director to oversee the day-to-day running of the team.\nReporting to Briatore, Nielsen has vast experience in the sport, having spent a large part of his earlier career with the Enstone-based outfit before going on to hold positions for commercial rights holder F1 and the FIA.\nBriatore, meanwhile, returned to Formula 1 in his current role with Alpine in 2024. The Italian previously experienced championship success at the outfit during their Benetton days in the early 1990s, as well as winning further titles with Fernando Alonso when the squad became Renault in the 2000s.\nGraeme Lowdon – Cadillac\nCadillac will make their F1 debut in 2026 as they became the 11th team on the grid – but they have an experienced name leading their charge, with Graeme Lowdon having been recruited as the squad’s Team Principal.\nLowdon has knowledge of setting up a new outfit, having previously brought Virgin Racing into the sport in 2010. He continued to run the team through its subsequent guise as Marussia before exiting prior to the squad’s final season in 2016.\nAfter working on various other projects – including acting as part of Zhou Guanyu’s management team – the Briton’s position with Cadillac was announced in December 2024, with his time since spent preparing for the American squad’s maiden Formula 1 campaign ."}

As the sun dips below the horizon, floodlights bring one of the most spectacular tracks on the calendar to life, and the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix gives us one last celebration of Formula 1 before the winter break.\nAbu Dhabi will serve as the F1 season finale for the 14th time in 2025 – and with a contract extension signed in 2021 , its position as the last race on the calendar until 2030 is secure.\nThis week marks the midway point of that deal, as we approach this season’s three-way fight for the 2025 Drivers’ Championship . It’s a perfect time to explore the Abu Dhabi venue, some of its iconic races, and everything that makes it the perfect season finale.\nLegendary showdowns under the floodlights\nYas Marina has delivered some of F1's most unforgettable moments. The 2010 race was the only time in history that four drivers entered the final race with a chance to become champion.\nSebastian Vettel was 15 points behind Fernando Alonso heading into the 19th round of the season, with Mark Webber and Lewis Hamilton also in contention.\nThe German took pole and the race win, while Ferrari ’s Alonso got stuck behind the Renault of Vitaly Petrov. As Vettel crossed the line to secure his first title, his race engineer produced the iconic line, “Du bist Weltmeister,” cueing wild celebrations on the podium and into the night.\nThe 2014 finale saw Hamilton secure his second championship, as he bagged a whopping 50 points from his final race win, as there were double points on offer.\nIn 2016, the two childhood friends and team mates Hamilton and Nico Rosberg faced off for the championship. Needing to overturn a 12-point deficit, the Brit threw everything at Rosberg, backing him up into the chasing Ferrari of Vettel and Red Bull of Max Verstappen . But Rosberg held on, winning his one and only title, before retiring a week later on the highest of highs.\nAnd then there was 2021. Verstappen and Hamilton had given us one of the great F1 seasons, culminating in an Abu Dhabi showdown with both drivers tied on 369.5 points.\nThe Mercedes driver had taken the lead from the Dutchman early on, and looked in control until a late Safety Car with five laps to go.\nRed Bull gambled with a pit stop, and following a controversial Safety Car procedure, Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the final lap of the season to win the first of his World Championships.\nMost recently, in the 2024 race, Lando Norris delivered a commanding victory that secured McLaren 's first Constructors' Championship in 26 years . Can the boys in papaya make history two years in a row by claiming the Drivers' title trophy this weekend?\nWorld-class facilities on a purpose-built island\nDesigned by legendary track designer Hermann Tilke, the circuit is located on Yas Island, an artificial 25 km² piece of reclaimed land on the east coast of Abu Dhabi.\nStarting in 2006, the island was developed from a blank canvas, with the Yas Marina Circuit completed by October 2009 at a reported cost exceeding $1.32 billion. The original layout was adjusted for the 2021 race to improve track flow and provide more overtaking opportunities.\nAll this investment has produced a track with impressive facilities, highlighted by F1 choosing Yas Marina to host the post-season test, where new Pirelli tyres are trialled by a variety of drivers.\nBut Yas Island offers far more than just the circuit. Walking around the island, you’ll discover seven hotels, the Ferrari World indoor theme park, a mall, a water park, a golf course, a beach, a concert arena and a nightclub.\nThe iconic W Abu Dhabi hotel, with its distinctive whale-shaped architecture, even straddles the track. The island certainly isn’t a bad place to celebrate a title.\nThe ultimate end-of-season celebration\nAbu Dhabi has become synonymous with celebration, both on and off the track. Whether it’s a championship victory, a surprise podium, or a driver farewell, there’s plenty to celebrate at Yas Marina. And drivers have a favourite way to enjoy their last outing in the car for the year – the donut. Spinning cars producing a smokescreen in front of the grandstands is always a crowd favourite, no matter the occasion.\nThe 2024 race had plenty of tear-jerking fond farewells. Hamilton competed in his final race as a Mercedes driver before his 2025 move to Ferrari, and he shared a special moment on the grid with his car after the race. Carlos Sainz ran his last race for Ferrari before joining Williams , while Kevin Magnussen and Zhou Guanyu completed their final racing laps in an F1 car, for now.\nYas Marina has also seen the retirements of many other drivers over the years. Vettel called time on his career in 2022, with the whole weekend featuring tributes to the four-time Champion, including “Danke Seb” shirts all over the paddock .\nThe 2007 World Champion Kimi Raikkonen retired at the 2021 race, Felipe Massa finished his career in 2017 with 11 race victories and 41 podiums, and 2009 saw the final race in Giancarlo Fisichella’s 14-year career. These emotional moments add layers of meaning beyond championship battles, making the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix feel that much more special.\nThe original day-to-night race\nThe 2009 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was F1’s first day-night race, differentiating Yas Marina from the six total night races on the calendar. Drivers must adapt their vision as the race progresses, aided by around 4,700 light fixtures illuminating the circuit. There's something almost poetic about watching the sun set on both the race and the entire F1 season simultaneously.\nThe visual spectacle doesn't stop there. The Main Grandstand offers prime views of Abu Dhabi's famed pyrotechnics, with firework displays lighting up the desert sky to celebrate the season's conclusion, and this year, the newly crowned World Champion.\nEntertainment and fashion take over\nRecently, the season finale atmosphere has brought out the best fashion and entertainment. Abu Dhabi has elevated the race weekend into a festival – welcoming over 125,000 spectators.\nThis weekend, Katy Perry, Benson Boone, Post Malone and Metallica will all take to the stage for post-race concerts. Plus, after-parties featuring DJ sets from Idris Elba and Calvin Harris will transform the event into a week-long celebration that attracts music lovers alongside motorsport fans.\nThere’s a long tradition of iconic post-race concerts, including the likes of Britney Spears, Jay-Z, Rihanna, Lana Del Rey, Eminem, Beyonce, Maroon 5, Guns N’ Roses, Kendrick Lamar, Pharrell Williams and many more. Plus, who could forget the final scenes of F1 The Movie being filmed on the Abu Dhabi podium? With A-list actors and world-class drivers on the podium together, it was an iconic image that captured the uniqueness of Yas Marina.\nAttendees also go all out for the final race weekend – as it’s the last chance to make a statement before the off-season.\nAbu Dhabi is host to some spectacular fashion moments, including stunning guest looks, but none more so than Hamilton’s fits from 2024. His fashion choices reflected the transition from his Mercedes era to his Ferrari beginning.\nHe entered the paddock on Thursday in an all-white Willy Chavarria look, slowly transitioning to an all-red Ferrari-inspired outfit by the end of the weekend – a fitting way to say goodbye to his former team and welcome in the new Ferrari era."}

But will it be Lando Norris, Max Verstappen or Oscar Piastri who leaves the Yas Marina Circuit with the title? Our writers – Lawrence Barretto, Chris Medland, David Tremayne, James Hinchcliffe and Alex Jacques – have shared their predictions for what might unfold at this weekend’s championship decider…\nLawrence Barretto (F1 Correspondent & Presenter): For the first time in 15 years, the championship is going to the wire with three still in contention, and in my view it is exactly what this year's sensational Formula 1 campaign deserves.\nI'm sure reigning World Champion Max Verstappen will make it interesting – and he's my pick for the race win. But I think Lando Norris , who dominated last year's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, is still the favourite for the title as he's the only one in control of his own destiny, given he leads by 12 points .\nAnd while he's had a difficult two races leading up to this weekend, I think he'll find a way to get over the line for a maiden title.\nWhatever happens for Verstappen, this has been his best season ever in my eyes. He should have been out of the fight ages ago (he was 104 points behind after Zandvoort) after Red Bull 's mid-season slump, but he's found a way to hang in there.\nOscar Piastri is the outsider, which is remarkable given he led by 34 points after the Dutch Grand Prix. His bounce back to form in Qatar means he definitely can't be counted out – but I feel like he's got just a bit too much to do to snatch the lead back when it counts.\nChris Medland (Special Contributor): I’m still not quite sure how we’ve ended up here, with a three-way fight at the final round. It looked like an all-McLaren championship battle was possible until the end of the season, but what Max Verstappen and Red Bull have managed to achieve is pretty remarkable.\nStill, for all of the focus on McLaren’s errors in Qatar , or the disqualification in Las Vegas , the main factor I’m taking away from both races is that the car is still extremely quick, and this championship would actually be over right now but for the skid block issues 10 days ago.\nThe way Verstappen and Red Bull have closed in will really put the pressure on McLaren this weekend – and, if given even half a chance to snatch the championship, you know Verstappen will take it – but McLaren don’t need to do anything special with their car to give Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri everything they need to win the title.\nLast year there was a different type of pressure relating to the Teams’ Championship, but Norris was faultless all weekend and given a top-three finish is all that he needs, I can see a repeat where Norris puts his car on pole and gets the job done.\nDavid Tremayne (Hall of Fame F1 Journalist): After McLaren’s strategic snafu in Qatar, F1 gets – for the first time since 2010 – a three-horse showdown in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.\nEven though Lando Norris’ 24-point pre-Qatar lead has been slashed to just 12 over Max Verstappen, with Oscar Piastri another four further back, the odds still favour the Englishman. He will become World Champion, cut and dried, if he finishes third, regardless of where either Max or Oscar finish.\nFourth or fifth would also do – which might be handy if Mercedes are strong – but only if somebody other than Max wins. Ditto sixth or seventh, provided neither Max nor Oscar wins. In extremis, he could still pulI it off with eighth, provided Max doesn’t finish in the top two or Oscar doesn’t win.\nIn other words, he could stroke it if necessary, but trying to do that often backfires and I’d expect him to be as sharp and hungry as he possibly can be and to fight for the win.\nNo matter how nonchalant the reigning champion is – and that’s genuine – you’d better believe he wants to be the first man since Michael Schumacher to win five titles in row… And on Qatar form he’ll be a huge threat to McLaren’s aspirations. Equally, Oscar feels he is owed a victory after last weekend left him “speechless” just after he’d rediscovered his mojo.\nBack in 2010 Ferrari focussed totally on Mark Webber in the race in Abu Dhabi , but as Red Bull refused to favour the Australian via team orders, Sebastian Vettel in the other Red Bull snuck through to beat his team mate and Fernando Alonso .\nThat marked only the third time in history that the eventual champion was the man who only led the points table after the final round (the others being John Surtees in 1964 and James Hunt in 1976). Might Max match that little bit of history too?\nLike the baddie in a pantomime, fans are looking at him and yelling the warning to Lando: “He’s behind you!” But unlike Ferrari 15 years ago, McLaren are only too aware of the threat the third man poses. How they deal with that, while trying to balance their 'papaya rules' without tripping over themselves in that well-meaning but risky process, may ultimately determine who walks away wearing the 2025 crown.\nJames Hinchcliffe (IndyCar Race Winner and Analyst): I don’t think anyone, at any point of the season, would’ve realistically thought we would have a genuine three-way title fight coming into the final round.\nI also don’t think anyone saw a scenario where Mclaren – a team that locked up the Teams’ title with six races to go – would not be 1-2 in the Drivers’ battle coming into Abu Dhabi. Yet here we are. On the brink of one of the greatest comebacks – or most phenomenal fumbles – in sporting history.\nAll three drivers have been superb this year and each have a strong case for being a deserving champion in 2025. You can go back and point out races for each where points were lost or gained, but all that is irrelevant now. Now, it all comes down to this one race.\nThat said, when you look at the numbers and play out the scenarios, my prediction is a Lando Norris title. He only needs a podium to secure the title and he has only been outside the top three at the flag twice in the last eight Grands Prix, with one of those being the Baku horror show .\nThrow in the fact that Yas Marina is a lower grip track than Qatar and recent trends show the lower the grip, the bigger the advantage he has over Oscar Piastri in the sister car. I still think Max Verstappen can, and likely will, win the race, but Lando has enough in the pocket to bring home the title.\nAlex Jacques (F1 TV Commentator): I'm delighted we're getting a three-way title fight for the first time in 15 years, and history tells us the last two times this has happened, the driver in third in the standings at the start has claimed the title by the end of the day. It was Kimi Raikkonen in 2007 and Sebastian Vettel in 2010.\nThat's about the most hopeful line I can write for Oscar Piastri fans. In Formula 1's ultra reliable age, the Australian driver realistically needs contact between his other two title rivals to have a chance - not impossible, but unlikely given Lando Norris doesn't need to win.\nI expect whoever takes pole to win the race and, given Max Verstappen seems to be feeling zero pressure, it's most likely to be him. Despite Verstappen's heroic comeback, I think he'll just fall short as I can't see Norris missing the podium, so my prediction is we'll be watching the first McLaren Drivers' title since 2008 on Sunday with Norris claiming his first championship."}

It meant the Silver Arrows finished 18 points ahead of Red Bull – but while team boss Toto Wolff was pleased, he was not over the moon with the race itself.\nRussell started fourth but lost places off the line courtesy of some wheelspin, and from there struggled for pace and could not catch up to the back of Charles Leclerc ahead to challenge for fourth or even the rostrum.\nKimi Antonelli had an even more frustrating race down the order, finishing well out of the points in 15th place. But Russell’s points were enough to ensure Mercedes ended the season with that P2 in the Teams’ Championship , despite Max Verstappen winning the race for Red Bull.\n“Our race can be summed up in one word: mediocre. It was a lonely one for George who wasn’t threatened from behind but didn’t have the pace of the front four cars,” Wolff explained.\n“He was managing his tyres to bring the car home on the one-stop, and he did that successfully. For Kimi, he tried his best from a difficult starting position, but we just didn’t have the speed in the car to enable him to get back into the points.\n“It is not the way we wanted to end the year, but we can be pleased we secured P2 in the Constructors’. Since the midpoint of the season, that has been our aim.”\nMcLaren were runaway winners of the Championship, scoring 833 points to Mercedes’ 469. It leaves Mercedes without a Constructors’ crown since 2021, but they did at least improve on last season’s fourth-place finish.\n“It is not what we as Mercedes ultimately want to be fighting for though, and hopefully we can prove ourselves worthy of being in a world title fight next year,” Wolff concluded.\nMercedes can at least point to the fact that Russell took two wins in a season dominated by McLaren and Verstappen as a positive, along with the introduction of rookie Antonelli to a full-time race seat, with the teenager having some standout performances towards the end of the year and taking three podiums.\nBut with the regulations set to change for 2026, it remains to be seen if Mercedes will start the next era as strong as they did with the dawn of the turbo-hybrid era in 2014."}

But what about those who went before him – and where have they all ended up?\nAs Lindblad gets set for his rookie campaign, F1.com runs through the list of Red Bull talents that climbed the ranks to represent either the drinks company’s senior F1 team or their aforementioned sister outfit, who previously went by the names of AlphaTauri and Toro Rosso.\nChristian Klien\nBefore committing to a full-time F1 entry, Red Bull had a record of sponsoring teams and backing young motorsport talent – beginning with Austrian drivers Christian Klien , Patrick Friesacher and Bernhard Auinger, and a dedicated ‘Red Bull Junior Team’ that competed in Formula 3000 between 1999 and 2003.\nIn 2004, Klien became the first Red Bull junior to compete in F1 by landing a drive at Jaguar. He remained onboard for the 2005 season when Red Bull took over the car manufacturer’s entry and made their F1 debut, albeit sharing a seat with another rising star in Vitantonio Liuzzi .\nOccasional points finishes were enough to keep a drive alongside David Coulthard into 2006, but that would be his last full-time campaign in F1. Several test and reserve roles followed, including at Honda and BMW Sauber, before a final trio of race Grand Prix outings for backmarkers Hispania in 2010.\nKlien embarked on a career in sportscars following his Red Bull exit, finishing third in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2008, and has remained active until recent years – dovetailing those duties with F1 commentary and punditry for Austrian television.\nVitantonio Liuzzi\nAs touched on above, Liuzzi also had a shot in a Red Bull cockpit in 2005 after winning the previous year’s F3000 title (the equivalent of F2 back then), but despite scoring points on his debut at the San Marino Grand Prix, that stint lasted just four race weekends.\nLiuzzi was given a second chance to prove himself at Red Bull’s new junior team, Toro Rosso, from the 2006 season. He stayed there for two years, spending a handful of races alongside future four-time World Champion Sebastian Vettel , before being dropped.\nAfter a year-and-a-half out, Liuzzi returned to F1 action with Force India midway through 2009 as a substitute for Giancarlo Fisichella (who had been signed by Ferrari to replace the injured Felipe Massa and under-performing stand-in Luca Badoer). He completed a full season in 2010 – achieving a personal best haul of 21 points – and then switched to Hispania for 2011.\nLiuzzi went on to race in a host of different motorsport categories after his time in F1, from V8 Supercars to Super Formula, and remains a paddock presence to this day thanks to him acting as driver steward for F1’s governing body, the FIA.\nRobert Doornbos\nWhile Liuzzi won the 2004 F3000 title, fellow Red Bull-backed racer Robert Doornbos classified third in the standings, the year he also started his F1 career by conducting test duties – and making Friday practice outings – for Jordan.\nDoornbos completed more practice runs with Eddie Jordan ’s squad in 2005 before switching to Minardi mid-season and replacing Friesacher on the grid. He then slotted into Red Bull’s reserve ranks for 2006, supporting Coulthard and Klien, and taking the latter’s seat at the final three Grands Prix of the year.\nA spell in America saw him finish third in the Champ Car World Series standings, and have a crack at IndyCar, paving the way for a second career as a respected motorsport pundit in his home country of the Netherlands, amongst plenty of business interests.\nScott Speed\nScott Speed was America’s next F1 hope when he graduated to the top echelon in 2006 via an impressive rise through the single-seater ranks – the California native battling ulcerative colitis (a form of inflammatory bowel disease) along the way.\nHis time in the championship lasted just one-and-a-half seasons, however, via run-ins with established Red Bull racer Coulthard and Toro Rosso team boss Franz Tost, and questions over an “outrageous” ego that was tamed post-F1.\nSpeed later tackled NASCAR and Rallycross back home in the United States (fracturing his vertebrae in a heavy 2019 crash), while maintaining his links to the Red Bull brand, and now spends most of his time helping upcoming drivers maximise their potential on and off the track.\n1 / 2\nDoornbos (left) also got a run out for Red Bull at the end of the 2006 season\nSebastian Vettel\nSpeed’s mid-2007 exit from Toro Rosso opened up a spot for the highly rated Vettel, who had already caught the eye during practice runs and a point-scoring debut – in place of the injured Robert Kubica – with BMW Sauber.\nAfter a tricky start, Vettel found his feet and began to show the F1 world what he was made of, scoring a brilliant wet-weather victory on Toro Rosso’s home soil at Monza and earning promotion to the senior Red Bull team for 2009.\nMaking the most of Adrian Newey ’s technical genius, Vettel racked up a huge number of pole positions and victories over the next few years, claiming back-to-back Drivers’ Championship titles from 2010 to 2013, and cementing his legendary status.\nA blockbuster move to Ferrari followed in 2015, but he ultimately missed out on adding another crown across six rollercoaster campaigns at the famous Italian marque, with one last hurrah coming via a two-year spell at Aston Martin in 2021-22.\nHe has since embarked on various initiatives to improve the world we live in, including a ‘Buzzin’ Corner’ biodiversity project in 2023 and a recycled helmet creation in 2024, while 2025 featured a Race4Women event in Saudi Arabia and the birth of the ‘F1FOREST’ .\nSebastien Buemi\nFollowing Vettel’s Red Bull promotion, Toro Rosso became a team of ‘Sebastiens’ in 2009 when GP2 race winner Buemi joined incumbent Bourdais, but the Swiss racer would not follow that path to the main team and championship triumphs.\nBuemi lasted three seasons – which featured some solid points finishes but few stand-out moments – before Toro Rosso overhauled their driver line-up again, forcing him to look outside F1 and begin a new chapter in the endurance world.\nHe enjoyed plenty of success over the years that followed, winning the World Endurance Championship and the 24 Hours of Le Mans four times (two alongside Fernando Alonso ), while also returning to single-seaters in the electric Formula E series – earning the title in 2015-16.\nAlongside this, Buemi has retained links to Red Bull Racing in a test, reserve and development capacity, playing a crucial role on their simulator and providing support to the F1 team wherever he could over the last decade or so.\nJaime Alguersuari\nBuemi shared most of his F1 journey with Jaime Alguersuari , who replaced Bourdais part-way through 2009 and became the sport’s youngest-ever driver at 19 years, four months and three days old – Max Verstappen , Lance Stroll , Kimi Antonelli and Oliver Bearman dipping below that marker since.\nAlguersuari enjoyed a particularly strong run of form in 2011, scoring points in seven out of 11 mid-season races, including P7 finishes in Italy and South Korea, but it was not enough to convince Red Bull chiefs to keep him in their programme.\nAfter missing out on a seat elsewhere on the F1 grid, Alguersuari made sporadic outings in German GT, Brazilian Stock Cars and Formula E, but he soon decided to retire and focus on his other passion of music production – the Spaniard now performing as DJ ‘Squire’ .\nJean-Eric Vergne\nWith both Buemi and Alguersuari pushed out, Jean-Eric Vergne formed half of another all-new Toro Rosso line-up in 2012, having won the British F3 title, finished second in Formula Renault 3.5 and performed well during F1 test and practice runs.\nLike Buemi, Vergne’s career would last three seasons, across which Red Bull were never quite convinced to promote him to the senior team. For 2014, it was Daniel Ricciardo who replaced the out-going Mark Webber , and for 2015, it was Daniil Kvyat who took Vettel’s spot.\nAgain, like Buemi, Vergne has combined Formula E and endurance racing since dropping off the F1 grid – winning the electric championship crown in 2017-18 and 2018-19, and continuing into the 2025-26 season, while becoming a regular at Le Mans.\n1 / 2\nAlguersuari became the then-youngest driver in F1 history when he debuted in 2009\nDaniel Ricciardo\nRicciardo made his F1 debut with Hispania – as team mate to Liuzzi – at the 2011 British Grand Prix, completing half a season in back-of-the-grid machinery before Red Bull bosses sent him to Toro Rosso alongside Formula Renault 3.5 rival Vergne.\nWhen fellow Australian Webber retired from F1, Ricciardo got the nod to replace him for the start of the turbo-hybrid era in 2014, having shaded that intra-team battle with Vergne, and he soon made his mark by claiming a trio of Grand Prix wins across the season.\nRicciardo made Red Bull his home after that, winning more races in 2016, 2017 and 2018, and forming an effective partnership with future champion Verstappen. However, for 2019, as the Dutchman’s standing inside the team grew, Ricciardo opted for a switch to Renault.\nTwo years with the French manufacturer failed to deliver the results both parties had been hoping for, prompting another move to McLaren where, despite winning a dramatic 2021 Italian Grand Prix, Ricciardo generally struggled next to Lando Norris and lost his seat to Oscar Piastri .\nAfter a spell on the sidelines, Ricciardo was given one more chance to show that he still had what it took to fight with the very best, heading to AlphaTauri as Nyck de Vries ’ replacement in mid-2023, but he could not quite do enough to earn his “dream” of a Red Bull return.\nRicciardo went off-grid in 2025, before emerging to explain how he was going through “a bit of self-exploration” while “trying to figure out who I am” beyond racing. Later, he became a Global Ambassador for the Ford Racing division , and effectively confirmed his retirement.\nDaniil Kvyat\nGP3 champion Kvyat was fast-tracked to F1 in 2014, hopping into the Toro Rosso seat vacated by Red Bull-bound Ricciardo, and he took another leap at the end of his rookie season when he replaced Ferrari-bound Vettel at the senior team for 2015.\nKvyat out-scored Ricciardo over the course of their first season together, but an up-and-down start to 2016 – mixed with Red Bull’s desire to promote Verstappen – saw the Russian swiftly sent back to Toro Rosso in dramatic circumstances .\nDespite doing all he could to rebuild his career and find a way into a Red Bull seat again, with his efforts yielding a podium at the rain-hit 2019 German Grand Prix , Kvyat had to settle for a few more campaigns at the sister team before bowing out of the sport.\nPost-F1, Kvyat has tried his hand at several championships, from NASCAR to the World Endurance Championship, while he is also involved in the development of the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League, serving as a human benchmark.\nCarlos Sainz\nThe next cycle of Toro Rosso drivers came in 2015, when the ousted Vergne and new Red Bull racer Kvyat were replaced by Carlos Sainz and Verstappen – the Spaniard stepping up after beating Pierre Gasly to the 2014 Formula Renault 3.5 title.\nSainz and Verstappen pushed each other hard in the intra-team stakes, but Red Bull’s hierarchy favoured the Dutch youngster when it came to a spot at the senior team which, as outlined above, went his way in the early stages of the 2016 season.\nWhile Verstappen settled in at Red Bull, Sainz ploughed on at Toro Rosso and, with no sign of a promotion on the horizon, he looked elsewhere – joining Renault towards the end of 2017 and later enjoying a competitive stint at McLaren as Norris’ new team mate.\nThen, for 2021, Sainz was poached by Ferrari to replace four-time champion Vettel, raising his stock further alongside the Scuderia’s long-time protégé Charles Leclerc by earning a maiden pole position and Grand Prix victory.\nSainz stayed with Ferrari for four seasons, winning three more races, before a bombshell announcement dropped that Lewis Hamilton would be taking his place from 2025 – eventually sending him in Williams’ direction, where he has already contributed heavily to their rebuild .\nMax Verstappen\nAs Sainz transitioned to Renault, then McLaren, then Ferrari, then Williams, Verstappen stayed put at Red Bull, building on an incredible race-winning debut for the team at the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix to become a consistent front-runner.\nWhen Red Bull and Honda produced a competitive enough package in 2021, Verstappen did not need to be asked twice – the Dutchman taking the fight to Mercedes rival Hamilton and ultimately coming out on top after a final-round showdown in Abu Dhabi.\nPlenty more was to come from Verstappen, who won the next three titles on the bounce – under F1’s ground effect era – to equal Vettel and Red Bull’s previous championship-winning run, and write his name into the history books as one of F1’s greatest drivers.\nThe 2025 season was tougher for Verstappen, with Red Bull lacking pace and consistency compared to rivals McLaren, but a remarkable comeback over the second half of the year saw him fall just two points short of what would have been a record-equalling fifth straight crown.\nVerstappen is now preparing to enter a 10th full season as a Red Bull driver, while exploring other motorsport interests outside F1, having set up his own endurance team and triumphed on his GT3 race debut at the Nurburgring Nordschleife last year.\nPierre Gasly\nAs mentioned earlier in this piece, Gasly’s F1 break came in the final rounds of 2017 – Toro Rosso making several late-season changes when they dropped Kvyat, allowed Sainz to join Renault early and also tried out endurance star Brendon Hartley .\nGasly could not get a point on the board across those five outings, but he impressed in the early stages of his first complete season with a fine run to fourth at the Bahrain Grand Prix, and starred again with drives to seventh in Monaco and sixth in Hungary.\nWith Ricciardo heading to Renault, Red Bull called on Gasly to join Verstappen at the senior team in 2019, but his time there lasted just 12 races – the Frenchman struggling to get comfortable in a second seat that many drivers have found challenging since then.\nGasly enjoyed a rebirth on his return to Toro Rosso/AlphaTauri, pipping Hamilton to second at the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix, claiming an emotional home win for the team at the 2020 Italian Grand Prix, and reaching the rostrum again at the 2021 Azerbaijan Grand Prix.\nFor 2023, though, Gasly left the Red Bull family, linking up with Alpine and forming an all-French driver pairing alongside old karting rival Esteban Ocon . Following the latter’s move to Haas, Gasly became the de facto team leader as ‘Team Enstone’ push to get back to winning ways .\nBrendon Hartley\nHartley had an unusual journey to the F1 grid, initially climbing the single-seater ranks with Red Bull support, and taking on test/reserve duties for the senior and sister teams, but then failing to kick on in Formula Renault 3.5 and GP2, and heading for sportscars.\nIt looked as though the moment had passed until late-2017 when, in his own words, the “somewhat of a surprise” chance arrived amid Toro Rosso’s reshuffling of seats – those four outings paving the way for a full-time drive the following year.\nHowever, while Hartley made it into the points on three occasions in 2018, he was comprehensively beaten by team mate Gasly, leading to the New Zealander being dropped from Red Bull’s roster again and going back to endurance competition.\nHartley put that disappointment behind him to take back-to-back World Endurance Championship titles in 2022 and 2023 (when he shared the cockpit with Buemi), adding to previous triumphs in 2015 and 2017, while he is also a three-time winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.\nAlex Albon\nAlex Albon was another driver who appeared to have missed the F1 boat following a low-key 2017 F2 season, but he returned to the feeder series in 2018 to take four wins and finish third in the standings behind George Russell and Norris – peers who rated him highly from his karting days.\nDropped by Red Bull several years before, Albon rejoined the programme – backing out of a planned Formula E deal in the process – to join Kvyat at Toro Rosso for 2019, becoming only the second Thai driver to race in F1 after Prince Birabongse Bhanudej Bhanubandh (better known as Prince Bira) in the 1950s.\nHe started well, scoring points in five of his first 12 Grands Prix, including a best result of sixth in Germany – form that proved strong enough to earn a rapid mid-season promotion to the senior team as Gasly’s replacement.\nAlbon was a consistent points scorer at Red Bull, but again struggled to match Verstappen’s relentless pace, meaning his time was also up after just a season-and-a-half – Red Bull demoting him to a reserve role for 2021 and signing Sergio Perez in his place.\nAfter a year on the sidelines, which included plenty of hours in Red Bull’s simulator, Albon secured an F1 return with Williams, going from strength to strength over the last four seasons and arguably putting together his most competitive campaign to date in 2025.\nYuki Tsunoda\nBacked by Honda through his single-seater career, Yuki Tsunoda arrived on the F1 scene in 2021, joining Gasly at AlphaTauri – powered by the manufacturer’s engines – after taking the Japanese F4 title, winning in F3 and finishing third in the F2 standings.\nTsunoda earned plenty of praise for a points-scoring debut, and ended his debut season with a personal best P4 finish, but dotted between those results were costly incidents, early Qualifying exits and missed opportunities, as well as a fair few radio outbursts.\nHe received more time than some of those before him to round off those rough edges, and at the conclusion of the 2024 campaign was given an “outstanding” report card from Laurent Mekies, who had taken over from Tost as AlphaTauri’s team boss.\nWhile there were clear signs of growth on Tsunoda’s side, there was no room at the Red Bull inn for several years thanks to the continuing Verstappen/Perez partnership, and when a position finally opened up for 2025, super-sub Liam Lawson got the call.\nAnother sequence of second seat musical chairs soon followed, with Lawson and Tsunoda swapping places just two rounds into the season, but the Japanese racer – like so many before him – found life difficult alongside reigning champion Verstappen.\nTsunoda kept his seat until the end of the campaign, but ultimately lost out to Isack Hadjar when it came to a 2026 drive, meaning test and reserve duties – for both the Red Bull Racing and Racing Bulls outfits – are now in store.\nLiam Lawson\nLawson had been knocking on the F1 door for several years when a surprise, last-minute opportunity popped up at the 2023 Dutch Grand Prix, where regular AlphaTauri driver Ricciardo broke his hand in a practice accident.\nDealing with a new car and tricky, mixed weather conditions, Lawson performed admirably over the course of that debut weekend, before well and truly sending a message in Singapore when he pipped Verstappen to a spot in Q3 and raced his way to ninth.\nWith Ricciardo returning to action in Austin, Lawson’s stand-in run was soon over, but he found himself back in action almost exactly one year later – this time replacing the Australian on performance grounds for the final six rounds of 2024.\nLawson and Tsunoda were evenly matched during that period, but when Red Bull decided to part ways with Perez, the New Zealander was favoured for a promotion, given what he had been displaying with significantly less experience.\nIt was a dream that quickly turned into a nightmare, however, with Lawson lasting just two weekends before being unceremoniously sent back to Racing Bulls. Since then, he has rebuilt his reputation via several points-scoring displays, and will continue at the sister team into F1’s new era of regulations.\nIsack Hadjar\nAlready mentioned several times in this feature, given the intertwining careers of drivers involved in Red Bull’s junior programme, last on the list is Hadjar – the Frenchman debuting at Racing Bulls in 2025 after finishing second to Gabriel Bortoleto in F2.\nHadjar’s start to life in F1 was a painful one, having spun at the start of the formation lap for the season opener in Australia, but he bounced back in style to put together a superb rookie term and leave no doubt in Red Bull’s mind over his future potential.\nPoints were scored in five out of seven Grands Prix between Japan and Spain, before Hadjar made headlines at the Dutch Grand Prix when he qualified fourth and finished a high-flying third behind championship challengers Piastri and Verstappen.\nHadjar continued to impress with more Q3 appearances and points, and a fierce determination to get better and better, making his promotion to Red Bull for 2026 a formality. Now he will be aiming to break the trend of his predecessors and stay there."}

It's what every Formula 1 driver wishes for, and they all came together on this unique occasion to praise the Briton.\nHe became the fourth champion on the current grid, joining an exclusive club that includes Max Verstappen , Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso , with the Dutchman losing out on winning his fifth consecutive title by just two points.\nHe endured crashes, tense intra-team battles and a mighty comeback by the Dutchman on his way to becoming McLaren's first victor since Hamilton back in 2008, taking third place at the Yas Marina Circuit to seal the title.\nChildhood rival George Russell, who is still waiting for his first opportunity to get stuck into a championship fight, took to social media to share a photo of the pair in their junior days, showing how far they've both come.\nHe also added: \"I want to wish congratulations to Lando as he becomes World Champion. We’ve raced together for so long and he is more than deserving of the title. Hopefully we can do battle on track next year for the 2026 crown!\"\n\"Congratulations to Lando too,\" his Mercedes team mate Kimi Antonelli said. \"He deserves it but also well done to both Max and Oscar Piastri who have also been brilliant this year. It was a great battle all year.\"\nCarlos Sainz, Norris' former team mate at the Woking outfit, also shared a compilation of the years they've spent competing against each other in F1, captioning the Instagram post: \"Massive congratulations to @lando on his first Drivers’ Championship! He’s an incredible driver and he has proven that you can achieve your highest goals staying true to yourself! Congrats my muppet friend! Well deserved!\"\nSpeaking after the race, the Spaniard told Sky Sports F1 : \"I'm very happy for him as a driver because I think he's always been an extremely quick driver, quicker than people give him credit for, and extremely talented since I worked with him at McLaren. I saw a guy that had the speed to be a multiple World Champion if it was purely down to speed.\n\"I think along the way he's developed a lot of his skills and now he's World Champion. More than anything, I'm happy for him as a person because I think he's a driver that doesn't follow the typical stereotype of a World Champion.\n\"I think he's always stayed very true to himself, very honest, very open about his own struggles. He's just proven to everyone that you can also be World Champion being a good guy and that open. You don't need to be ruthless or badass to show to everyone that you can be World Champion so I'm happy for him.\"\nAs the fireworks went off over the Yas Marina Circuit, Hamilton walked into Norris' post-race interview to say \"I told you!\" with a grin in a heartwarming moment, with both drivers now able to call themselves champions with McLaren.\nThere were also words of congratulations from Norris' 2025 title rivals, with Verstappen hoping the Briton enjoys the moment.\n\"Winning your first title is something that I think we all dreamt of when you get into the sport,\" the four-time World Champion said. \"You work for that since you're a little kid. It’s what you dream of.\n\"So, when you win your first title, this is very emotional. And, yeah, I hope for Lando as well. You know, I saw a lot of his family is here, so it’s important to enjoy this a lot as well tonight. Also, with his team.\n\"I think, again, that’s another story where it showed that even when you have tough years, when you keep working hard, you keep adding good people to the team, you can overcome all of those things, and you can become very successful again. And, yeah, they had an incredible season together, so it’s important that they enjoy it.\"\nAs for Norris' team mate and fellow title rival Piastri, who had led the championship himself for large portions of the season, the Australian also had nothing but words of praise for the new champion.\n\"I think a very deserving winner,\" he said when asked to give his thoughts on Norris' achievement. \"I know that every weekend I go on track, it’s going to be tough. And I think we’ve pushed each other through the last three years.\n\"I think, especially this season, [it] has been tighter than ever. So, yeah, I think he’s had a great season. Probably all three of us, but obviously, myself and Lando in the same team, in the same car, have had our ups and downs at different moments. Ultimately, I think he’s had a good season and a deserving champion.\""}
