The energy was palpable all weekend long, and with all the action on and off-track, Yas Marina never fails to close out the season in an epic fashion.\nDespite the best efforts from Max Verstappen , his Grand Prix win was not enough to claim his fifth world title, as Lando Norris secured his maiden championship by finishing P3. There was plenty to talk about on track, with penalties, team tactics and overtakes galore – but those weren’t the only stories from this epic weekend. Here are some magic moments you should know about from the season finale.\nChampionship celebrations\nYou never forget your first world title – and Norris certainly won’t be forgetting this one. In his seventh Formula 1 season, the Brit finally became a World Champion in Abu Dhabi, and the emotion hit him as soon as he took the chequered flag!\nAs he climbed out of the cockpit, his parents, Cisca and Adam, were already there waiting for him, who could barely contain their pride. Then came Verstappen and Oscar Piastri , his title rivals all year long, offering genuine smiles and warm embraces – a heartwarming moment from each competitor after such a hard-fought season.\nBut things really kicked off when Lando made it back to the McLaren garage, where the team launched straight into full celebration mode, drenching him with an avalanche of champagne. We hope someone fetched him a towel!\nAnd because no British celebration is complete without it, the night ended with videos circulating of Norris belting out “We are the Champions” and “Sweet Caroline” in a club, sat on shoulders, arms aloft. A perfect finale to an unforgettable day.\nWholesome moments at the drivers’ annual dinner\nIf you follow any of the drivers on social media, then we’re almost certain you won’t have missed this! Before the on-track tension of the season finale kicked in, the grid kept up what’s fast becoming a tradition: the annual drivers’ dinner. Nearly the full grid turned out for a relaxed evening dining together as a last chance to catch-up before the pressure of the final race takes over.\nThe now-iconic group photo made its annual return too, flooding everyone’s social media feeds as each driver posted the same shot with their own spin on the caption. Norris reassured everyone that no food was thrown, Yuki Tsunoda bemoaned some of the drivers missing the white shirt memo, and Alex Albon joked about the grid making bets for the title.\nThe dinner has happened every year since 2022 – serving as a wholesome reminder that even at the most high-stakes weekend of the year, there’s still room for a little camaraderie in the paddock.\nEmotional goodbyes\nAbu Dhabi has a way of blending end of season celebrations with nostalgia, and the 2025 finale leaned fully into both. Beyond the title fight wrapping up and the final race drama, teams and fans took some moments to say farewell to a few familiar faces and eras coming to an end.\nA new chapter for Tsunoda\nSunday’s Grand Prix is the last time we’ll see the #22 on the grid for a little while, as Abu Dhabi marked Tsunoda’s final race before stepping into a reserve role for the team in 2026. Tsunoda even had the support of some of his biggest fans who joined him in the garage ahead of lights out.\nOne of the most heartwarming moments from the weekend came post-race, when Tsunoda performed a helmet swap with his best friend on the grid, Pierre Gasly – we’re sure there wasn’t a dry eye in the house!\nAnd to top it off, actor Jason Statham and model Emily Ratajkowski joined the Japanese driver on Sunday to give him the send-off he deserves – and we can’t tell who was more star-struck! Taking on the role of the third driver next season, Tsunoda will be around the paddock next season, and we are already looking forward to seeing him!\nThe Sauber era comes to a close\nIt wasn’t just drivers saying goodbye in Abu Dhabi – this weekend also marked the end of the Sauber name in F1. After their debut in 1993, the team has taken some different identities during its three decade-long involvement in the sport, with countless races, iconic drivers and a legacy that stretches far beyond its most recent stint as the glowing green of Kick Sauber .\nThe team marked their final race by welcoming founder Peter Sauber to the garage for one last time with the Sauber name, as they go on to prepare over the winter to step into their new chapter as Audi .\nMercedes bid farewell to Bottas (again)\nAnd speaking of familiar faces we’ve loved having around… Valtteri Bottas has been just as present in the paddock this year – not only in his crucial role as Mercedes ’ reserve driver, but as one of the grid’s most reliable comedic sources. Few people can deliver a simulator session by night and a perfectly timed meme by day quite like Valtteri.\nThe team used the finale to celebrate the eccentric Finn before he heads to Cadillac for 2026, and of course in true Valtteri style, it was pure social media gold. There was one last Valtteri Explains instalment, a full slate of media work, a perfectly timed photobomb during the team photo, and of course, getting thrown into the harbour post-race. Peak Valtteri behaviour that we hope continues right into his time at Cadillac.\nGoodbye, DRS\nAnd finally, there was a surprisingly emotional farewell to… DRS. After over a decade of helping deliver some of the biggest overtakes in recent F1 history, Abu Dhabi marked its final outing before the brand-new regulations shake things up next season. Teams embraced the moment with playful tributes across social media in the form of some surprisingly emotional farewell videos – with Kimi Antonelli having the honour of being the last one to open his rear wing .\nFP1 rookie radio chaos\nNine rookies jumped into the cars for FP1 in Abu Dhabi – and with nine new voices on the radio, chaos was practically guaranteed... Names were mixed up, engineers made some interesting improvisations, and the airwaves quickly turned into some of the most memorable moments of the weekend.\nAt Ferrari , the team were quite literally seeing double as Arthur Leclerc joined his older brother Charles Leclerc for the session. Some engineers quickly realised that two Leclerc's could get a little confusing for their drivers, so had to get creative. Verstappen’s engineer Gianpiero Lambiase took the most logical route, calling Arthur “Leclerc Junior,” which the Dutchman (and us) found highly amusing. Later on, things escalated further when Gabriel Bortoleto ’s engineer Jose Manuel Lopez casually referred to Charles as “the big Leclerc.” Yes – it was that kind of day.\nAnd the sibling dynamic was on full display too. When Charles spun early in FP1, Arthur was straight on the radio – but no – he was not worried. “I think Charles is doing some burnouts for the fans!” he joked. A classic younger brother comment.\nThings only got more confusing for George Russell ’s race engineer Marcus Dudley, as he mixed up the names of two rookies, but thankfully George was on hand to help clarify things! Racing Bulls couldn’t help but poke fun at the whole situation... All in all, FP1 kept everyone on their toes!\nDrivers feeling glam\nFast cars, celebrities and high drama – it goes without saying F1 and glamour go hand-in-hand, but Abu Dhabi took things up a notch with the arrival of Cole Walliser’s infamous Glambot. And with it, the paddock became a Hollywood red carpet as drivers eagerly lined up to strike their most dramatic slow-motion poses… with varying degrees of success.\nThere were power stances aplenty, lots of crossed arms, and obviously a Bottas moustache special – the glam bot certainly delivered the goods.\nHadjar household\nIn another incredibly heartwarming moment over the weekend, Isack Hadjar hosted a very special guest in his garage – his dad Yassine Hadjar! The French-Algerian rookie has often spoken about how instrumental his father has been throughout his rise to F1, even honouring the scientist with the physics and quantum-mechanics equations that featured on his helmet.\nYassine looked right at home as he climbed into his son's car, unsurprisingly firing off plenty of questions to understand every detail of his son’s world in a moment we’re sure neither will ever forget.\nHadjar wasn’t the only one with family in his car, as Nico Hulkenberg possibly looked to inspire his daughter by getting her behind the wheel (in the safety of the garage) with her mother Egle Ruskyte.\nA moment for the Abu Dhabi looks\nThe final race of the season is the perfect excuse for drivers to don special edition helmets, and this year was no different.\nHulkenberg reached a huge milestone in Abu Dhabi, – reaching a staggering 250 races over his 15 years in F1! He celebrated with a gladiator-style helmet, and after battling his way to P9 from 18th on the grid – we think the design was pretty apt!\nPurple was the theme for Williams this weekend as they celebrated their fantastic season with special edition helmets for both drivers. Carlos Sainz ’s design even paid tribute to his lucky charm, “Sparkles”, who helped him to an incredible P3 in Baku this season – here's to hoping we’ll see more of Sparkles next year!\nThe Ferrari duo also went all out on their helmets for the final race. Leclerc’s helmet celebrated his impressive milestone of 150 races for the Maranello-based team, while Hamilton marked the end of his first season with the Scuderia with a mirror-styled lid, finished with gold glitter – another super eye-catching design from the seven-time World Champion!\nFrench duo Gasly and Esteban Ocon also marked the end of the season with one-off helmets, completing a sea of spectacular designs.\nCelebs filled the finale\nA title decider of this magnitude was always going to draw in famous names from across the world, but this may have been the most star-studded paddock of the year. Actress Ana de Armas spent time in Williams’ and Ferrari’s garages, before drawing the season to a close by waving the final chequered flag of 2025.\nSports stars were enticed by the drama of the weekend, with those in attendance including tennis players Jannik Sinner and Ons Jabeur, boxer Chris Eubank Jr, former footballers Thierry Henry and Micah Richards with their co-host Kate Scott, ex-NBA players Julius Erving, and Matt Barnes, streetball player Grayson ‘The Professor’ Boucher, cricketer Rashid Khan, and Ballon d’Or winning ex-footballer Ronaldinho.\nIn what proved to be a very musical weekend, rappers Central Cee and Skepta, singers Camila Cabello, Benson Boone, Katy Perry, Sam Ryder, will.i.am, the band Metallica, and DJs Peggy Gou, Adam Port, DJ Snake and Carl Cox were either performing or simply enjoying the race weekend in the desert.\nFinally, there were plenty of personalities from your screens at Yas Marina, including actors Idris and Sabrina Elba, Jessica Chastain, Madelaine Petsch, Jung Hae-in, Terry Crews, Liu Yifei, Marsai Martin, Winston Duke, Song Kang-Ho, TV host Molly Qerim, Bollywood actors Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone, and Yasmin Abdulaziz, models Yasmine Sabri, influencer Youmna Khoury and TikToker Khaby Lame.

But after starting from P4 on the grid, the Silver Arrows driver dropped backwards off the line.\nWhilst he subsequently managed to get back in front of the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso , Ferrari ’s Charles Leclerc proved uncatchable in fourth and Russell came home in a distant P5, marking a tough day for the Brackley-based outfit as team mate Kimi Antonelli was down the order in P15.\n“A dreadful race, start to finish,” Russell conceded afterwards. “We just had no pace – it was a bit odd. I was fifth, which is a result that was much better than the true picture.\n“Obviously Kimi being down in 15th is quite abnormal, for us as a team to be that far off.”\nDespite a difficult outing at the Yas Marina Circuit, it was enough for Mercedes to be confirmed as runners-up in the Teams’ Championship , having taken second place with an 18-point margin over Red Bull .\nAnd while Russell was glad to secure this, the 27-year-old admitted that he is keen to get the sport’s next era underway as a new wave of regulations come into effect for 2026.\n“I think you always want to end on a high, but we had a goal these last couple of race weekends, and that was just to secure P2 in the championship,” Russell explained.\n“I think we’re all very glad this era has come to a close, because it’s been a real challenging one for everyone bar McLaren and Red Bull, and we’re excited for a clean slate.”\nRussell and the rest of the field will not have long to wait for that fresh start, with the first of three pre-season tests set to take place in Barcelona from January 26-30."}

Pretty surreal.\n“I've dreamed of this for a long time, everyone does. A lot goes into a season like this, lot of ups, lot of downs, but none of that matters as long as you try and come out on top, and that's what we managed to do with an incredible team.”\nVerstappen wins the race, but just misses out\nAs touched on above, Verstappen did not make things easy for Norris in a closely-fought battle for the championship that went right down to the wire.\nOff the back of his triumphs in Las Vegas and Qatar, the Red Bull man knew he had to win again – and hope for some drama behind him – in order to take a fifth consecutive World Championship. As such, he put himself in the best possible position to do so by grabbing an impressive pole in Qualifying at the Yas Marina Circuit.\nFrom there Verstappen enjoyed a dominant drive to his eighth win of the season, the 28-year-old not putting a foot wrong as he did all he could to keep his title hopes alive. But with Norris sealing that essential third place, the #1 will ultimately move over to the Briton’s car in 2026 should he wish to have it.\nThe final result meant that Verstappen missed out on the Drivers’ Championship by a mere two points – and despite admitting that this might look “painful”, the four-time World Champion spoke of his pride at how he and Red Bull had managed to get themselves back into the fight, having been more than 100 points behind after Round 15 at Zandvoort.\n“The turnaround has been fun, and today has been fun,” Verstappen explained after the race . “We didn’t win the championship, okay, that happens, that’s life, and it’s not something that I’ll be too sad about. I mean, life goes on.\n“I’m just very proud of the people I work with, they are my second family, and we will enjoy this moment. We will enjoy the second half of the season, be proud of that, and next year is going to be a big question mark for everyone anyway.”\nPiastri settles for third in the standings after epic pass\nWith a 16-point margin to make up on team mate Norris, Piastri needed to do something special in Abu Dhabi and hope for misfortune to befall his team mate.\nWhile the latter didn't occur as Norris secured a maiden F1 title with P3, the Australian produced some magic and pulled off one of the overtakes of the season, going around the outside of his team mate at the banked Turn 9 on the opening lap.\nHaving shadowed race leader Verstappen, Piastri took the lead when the Red Bull driver pitted and held the position until the latter stages of the race after starting on the hard Pirelli rubber, in comparison to Verstappen and Norris on the medium.\nHaving rejoined on the medium tyre in second, Piastri was unable to close the gap to Verstappen and was left short of a maiden world title by 13 points.\n\"I tried my best and put myself in the best position I could to try and win the race and give myself the best opportunity, but it wasn’t to be,\" the 24-year-old said .\n\"I think we can be very proud of the season we’ve had. On a personal level, it’s obviously not quite the ending that I wished for but I think when you look at the season as a whole, I’m very proud of the work that I’ve been able to put in.\"\nThe Teams’ standings are finalised\nAway from the Drivers' title battle, the final placings in the Teams’ Championship were up for grabs and, with it, millions in prize money.\nWith George Russell P5 in the race, Mercedes claimed second in the standings by 18 points from Red Bull, with Ferrari a further 53 points back in fourth.\nNeither Carlos Sainz or Alex Albon finished in the points, though Williams had already secured P5 in Qatar, as Racing Bulls took sixth with Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson also not finishing inside the top-10 in Abu Dhabi.\nA P6 and P10 finish for Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll ensured Aston Martin finished P7, just three points behind Racing Bulls, while they were 10 points clear of Haas , the American outfit taking seventh in the race at the Yas Marina Circuit with Esteban Ocon .\nIn Kick Sauber 's final race before becoming Audi, the Swiss-based team finished ninth in the Teams' Championship as Nico Hulkenberg reached the points in P9, with Alpine failing to score and 48 points adrift in last.\nA star-studded attendance for the title-deciding finale\nThe great and the good from the world of showbusiness and sport attended the final race of the season to see who would claim this year's Drivers' Championship.\nActress Ana de Armas was on hand to wave the chequered flag for race winner Verstappen on Sunday, having been shown around the Ferrari garage by seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton .\nAhead of Norris' first Drivers' title, the McLaren garage was also graced by the presence of singer/songwriter Katy Perry, with fellow American musician Benson Boone also making an appearance.\nFrom the sporting world, tennis star Jannik Sinner made the trip, as did footballing legends Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho.\n1 / 4\nActress Ana de Armas waved the chequered flag at the end of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix"}

As he moves into a Red Bull reserve role in 2026, let’s explore his five seasons in the sport.\nAfter five seasons on the Formula 1 grid, it’s time to say goodbye to Yuki Tsunoda...sort of. The 25-year-old will still be part of the Red Bull family in 2026 as a reserve driver, while Isack Hadjar gets a promotion from Racing Bulls and Arvid Lindblad graduates from Formula 2. The Japanese driver’s career so far includes 111 Grands Prix, 124 points and a career-high P4 at the Abu Dhabi 2021 Grand Prix.\nWith this change in role, it’s the perfect opportunity to explore Tsunoda ’s time in F1 so far and what makes him such a fan favourite. Whether it’s his exciting overtakes, expressive radio rants, unmistakable style, or his bromance with Pierre Gasly , Tsunoda made a distinct impact in the world of motorsport on and off the track.\nOn-track triumphs\nTsunoda’s rise in the racing scene was meteoric, going from Japanese F4 to F1 in under four years. The prodigy coming out of Sagamihara was backed by Honda’s Formula Dream Project in 2016, helping him join the Red Bull junior team and get a seat in the 2020 F2 Championship with Carlin. Tsunoda looked right at home, finishing as the best-placed rookie in third, and claiming three wins, four poles and seven podiums. A clutch performance in the final round in Bahrain gave him enough FIA Super Licence points to join the 2021 F1 grid.\nIt didn’t take long for Tsunoda to develop a reputation for daring late moves, an aggressive driving style, and impressive raw speed. Franz Tost , his former Team Principal at AlphaTauri, said: “His driving style belongs to the modern driving styles. He knows what he wants – he doesn’t like a car that understeers or when the car washes out at the apex, and he doesn’t care about the rear of the car.” We saw this aggression immediately at the 2021 season opener in Bahrain , as Tsunoda made plenty of moves to claim P9 and points on debut.\nThe 2022 season was hampered by a severe downturn in pace for the AlphaTauri team, and some bad fortune, but provided valuable experience for the then 22-year-old. In 2023 and 2024, the newly named Racing Bulls began to try out a whole host of new drivers, each one Tsunoda was expected to beat. And he did exactly that, getting the better of Nyck de Vries, Daniel Ricciardo and Liam Lawson in the Drivers’ Standings to keep his spot on the grid. He also managed his best Qualifying at the 2024 Sao Paulo Grand Prix , taking P3 in tricky wet conditions.\nHaving earned a promotion to Red Bull within two races in 2025, Tsunoda wasn’t able to keep pace with Max Verstappen in the second seat, prompting the hierarchy to look elsewhere for 2026. However, Tsunoda has still had his moments this season, always driving with the type of determination that always draws fans in.\nSocial butterfly\nArriving on the grid in 2021 as the youngest driver in the field, you might have expected Tsunoda to take time settling into the rhythm of the F1 life – the constant travel, high intensity and the challenge of building relationships in a paddock – but he became a favourite among the drivers just as quickly as he became a favourite with the fans.\nThroughout his time at Racing Bulls (formerly AlphaTauri) and this year with Red Bull, Tsunoda has built strong, genuine connections with every team mate he’s shared a garage with – no small thing in a sport where driver pairings can often move in the opposite direction. Whether it’s been working through some challenging weekends or bringing his humour wherever he goes, he’s consistently created a sense of camaraderie in the garage that team mates and crew members alike have spoken warmly about.\nHowever, there was one driver with whom Tsunoda developed an excellent friendship, or ‘bromance.’ Tsunoda and Gasly got on like a house on fire, and in the two years they spent as team mates, they had many iconic moments off the track. Perhaps the most famous moment was the pair singing Adele’s ‘Hello’ in karaoke in Tokyo. While the singing may not be the best, it’s clear how much fun the two of them had at AlphaTauri.\nThe team’s social media made waves online with their challenges and behind-the-scenes content. Fans enjoyed moments such as Gasly making fun of Tsunoda for getting a speeding ticket, the Frenchman calling Tsunoda ‘Guiseppe’ for an entire year, the guys playing football and video games together, and the pair leaning into their ‘bromance’ at F1 events.\nTsunoda has ended up with a lot of different team mates at Racing Bulls and Red Bull, but he’s had his moments with all of them. He enjoyed playing padel with Verstappen, as well as messing around with him at the Drivers’ Parade in Brazil. Although his time with Hadjar and Liam Lawson was brief, we still got some enjoyable TikToks from the pair. Ricciardo clearly left a lasting impact on Tsunoda, and he posted a heartfelt tribute when the Aussie left the paddock.\nIt wasn’t just team mates who enjoyed Tsunoda’s infectious energy – the Tokyo native left a profound effect on fans, his crew, and even some celebrities.\nYuki’s special style\nTsunoda has always had a creative streak in him, especially when it comes to his helmet designs. There’s been plenty of eye-catching and meaningful lid designs, including his Honda tribute for the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, his Kabuki-inspired headgear for his 2025 home race in Suzuka, and his collaboration with the video game Valorant for the 2024 race in Spa-Francorchamps.\nAlthough he’s commonly spotted showing off the newest and boldest Red Bull merchandise and team kit, Tsunoda still has his fashionable moments in the paddock. From classic backwards hats to stylish sunglasses, Tsunoda is always looking cool between sessions. He’s pushed the boat out with some double denim looks and graphic tees, and he certainly turned heads at the F1 Movie premiere in New York.\nYuki: Unfiltered\nTsunoda may not have much of a filter, especially on team radio, but being unapologetically himself has endeared the 5ft 3in driver to his many fans. He quickly gained a reputation for expletive rants on team radio, leaving broadcasters scrambling for their bleep censors. But these reactions were honest and gave an insight into the passion Tsunoda has for racing, something he carried into his interviews and media duties.\nBut this isn’t the end for Tsunoda in Formula 1. We saw what happened when Alex Albon was dropped for the 2021 season – as the Thai driver earned a seat in Williams for the following year thanks to his relentless dedication in the simulator. Bottas also showed how a year as a reserve can reinvigorate a driver, as well as giving plenty of opportunity to complete side quests on social media. With some hard work and a bit of luck, Tsunoda could be back on the grid sooner than you think."}

His departure will leave a void, and we will truly miss him.\n\"I would like to express my sincere gratitude for his unwavering support, not only over the past months, but also during my early days at Scuderia Toro Rosso.\n\"On a personal note, Helmut, along with [CEO] Oliver Mintzlaff, was the driving force behind bringing me back into the Red Bull family, first in Faenza and then this summer in my current role in Milton Keynes.\n\"Helmut is a real racer at heart, always pushing us to the limit, always prepared to take risks in pursuit of our goals.\"\n\"I have been involved in motorsport for six decades now, and the past 20-plus years at Red Bull have been an extraordinary and extremely successful journey,” said Marko himself. “It has been a wonderful time that I have been able to help shape and share with so many talented people. Everything we have built and achieved together fills me with pride.\n“Narrowly missing out on the World Championship this season has moved me deeply and made it clear to me that now is the right moment for me personally to end this very long, intense, and successful chapter.\n“I wish the entire team continued success and am convinced that they will be fighting for both world championship titles again next year.“\nOliver Mintzlaff, Red Bull’s CEO of Corporate Projects and Investments, added that: “Helmut approached me with the wish to end his role as motorsport advisor at the end of the year. I deeply regret his decision, as he has been an influential figure for more than two decades, and his departure marks the end of an extraordinary era.\n“Over more than 20 years, Helmut has earned incomparable merits for our team and the entire Red Bull motorsport family. He played a decisive role in all key strategic decisions that made Red Bull Racing what it is today: a multiple world champion, an engine of innovation, and a cornerstone of international motorsport.\n“His instinct for exceptional talent not only shaped our junior program but also left a lasting impact on Formula 1 as a whole. Names like Sebastian Vettel and Max Verstappen stand for the many drivers who were discovered, supported, and guided to the very top under his leadership. His passion, his courage to make clear decisions, and his ability to spot potential will remain unforgettable.\n“After a long and intensive conversation, I knew I had to respect his wishes, as I gained the impression that the timing felt right for him to take this step. Even though his departure will leave a significant gap, our respect for his decision and our gratitude for everything he has done for Red Bull Racing outweigh it.\n“Helmut Marko will be deeply missed, both personally and professionally. We wish him all the very best for the future and hope that he will remain closely and warmly connected to the team.”\nF1 Correspondent Lawrence Barretto says...\nRed Bull have been prolific in backing young racing talent and supporting them on their journey to Formula 1 – and Marko should take a lot of credit for that.\nHe was the one who pushed Red Bull's founder Dietrich Mateschitz to give Verstappen his F1 debut in 2015 – ensuring that it was the energy drinks firm who got the Dutchman's signature rather than Mercedes.\nHe was the one in constant contact with junior formula teams trying to sniff out the next big thing.\nHe was the one who would sit down with the aspiring driver face-to-face, one-to-one and decide there and then whether or not they had what it took to deliver race wins in Formula 1 for the Red Bull family.\nThe impact has been impressive and long-lasting. Seven of the 20 drivers on this year's grid have come through the Red Bull Junior Programme – Verstappen, Alex Albon, Carlos Sainz, Isack Hadjar, Liam Lawson, Yuki Tsunoda and Pierre Gasly.\nBut nothing lasts forever – and Marko's departure is just the latest step in Red Bull's evolution."}

He's got a more likely shot of reaching the top three this year after qualifying fifth.\nFernando Alonso was sixth for Aston Martin, marking his highest start at the Yas Marina Circuit since 2012.\nAnother high flier was Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto, placing in P7. In the team's last weekend with the Sauber name, he helped them qualify in the top 10, which they also achieved in their first race back in 1993.\nOllie Bearman was the lead Haas for most of the weekend, but Esteban Ocon was the one to make it through to Q3 for the first time since the Monaco Grand Prix 14 races ago.\nJust behind the Frenchman, Isack Hadjar took P9 in his final race with Racing Bulls, rounding off his rookie season with five consecutive Q3 appearances.\nHe will replace Yuki Tsunoda at Red Bull in 2026. The Japanese racer bowed out of his last Qualifying session in style by ending his six-race run without progressing to Q3.\nBearman missed out on Q3 by just 0.007s, settling for P11.\nCarlos Sainz missed out on Q3 for only the second time in the final six rounds of the season, taking P12 for Williams.\nWith Hadjar ahead in P9, Liam Lawson has been outqualified by his team mate on 16 occasions in 2025.\nKimi Antonelli finished the session down in P14, but he has previously shown that he can charge through the field, having improved to the podium from 17th in Las Vegas.\nThe second Aston Martin of Lance Stroll made it through to Q2 for the ninth time this season.\nA downbeat Lewis Hamilton ends his first campaign with Ferrari with three consecutive Q1 eliminations – the first for the team since Giancarlo Fisichella in 2009.\nIt ties his longest career run of Q1 eliminations, also from 2009, but on the bright side, he progressed from 16th to fourth in the 2024 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.\nAlex Albon endured his seventh Q1 elimination of the season, finishing the session in P17.\nAfter showing some promising pace in practice, Nico Hulkenberg took 18th on the grid, ending his streak of seven consecutive Q3 appearances in Abu Dhabi.\nThe Alpine pair of Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto will start on the last row in their final race with Renault power units."}

Max Verstappen (Red Bull), 2. Lando Norris (McLaren), 3. Oscar Piastri (McLaren)\nPARC FERMÉ INTERVIEWS\n(Conducted by James Hinchcliffe)\nQ: Max, first of all, congratulations – 48th career pole. You found an enormous amount of lap time in Q3 there. Where did that come from?\nMax VERSTAPPEN: Well, in Q2 I stayed on scrubbed tyres and I think those laps already felt quite decent. And then in Q3 around here, you know, the track temp is coming down. You know that you can push a bit more and that's exactly what we did. We found a bit more lap time and, of course, incredibly happy to be in first. That's the only thing that we can do, right? That's the only thing that we can control, try to just maximise everything we have and then do what we can with the car – and we definitely did that in qualifying.\nQ: Max, conditions in FP3 were so different from what you see in qualifying. What's the challenge like for you and your engineers to decide what changes to make to the car knowing that when you get on track in qualifying, it's going to be so different than what you saw in practice?\nMV: Yeah. You have to try and guess a little bit how much the track is going to improve. Of course, it cools down a lot. But you're never like 100% sure if it's going to work. But I do think that what we changed definitely helped me a little bit more to feel better in qualifying.\nQ: Lando Norris starts outside of the front row. You guys are really writing the script for us – all three of you starting one, two, three. Lando, you're ahead of one championship rival, behind the other. Are you satisfied with how you did out there? Did you leave anything on the table?\nLando NORRIS: It's tough. I mean, Max did a good job, so congrats to him. We did everything we could. I think my lap was pretty good. I was pretty happy. So yeah, of course disappointed to not be on pole for the final weekend, but we were just not running fast enough today. So, we'll have to try do it tomorrow.\nQ: A podium tomorrow clinches the world championship for you. Is that then the goal? Are you just thinking about finishing on the podium or is it still going for the win?\nLN: I don't know. The time will come when I think of that. But for now, you know, disappointed to not be on pole, and I still want to try win tomorrow. So that's going to be the goal.\nQ: And Oscar, for you, great effort throughout. You were very quick in Q1, came up a little bit short in Q3. How was the run for you?\nOscar PIASTRI: Yeah. I mean, I think it was pretty good. I think the lap I did in Q1, it was nice to finally get into a rhythm through the weekend. And honestly, I think the last lap in Q3 was pretty good as well. There wasn't a whole lot left in that. No, just not quite quick enough today. But yep, sets up a pretty exciting day tomorrow.\nQ: Qualifying pace is one thing. Obviously race pace is a completely different thing. Do you think you've got what it takes to get by these two guys tomorrow for the win?\nOP: We'll find out tomorrow. I think Max has looked very quick in the long runs this weekend and clearly very quick over one lap. But yeah, let's see how much pace is a factor tomorrow.\nQ: Max, finally back to you. Obviously, a win essentially is all you can control, like you said. Is there any point worrying about what's happening behind you or is it just eyes forward for 58 laps?\nMV: We'll find out tomorrow, won't we? Let's see what we can do. Of course, I'll try to win the race, but also in the back of my mind, we want to try and score a lot of points to still try and win that championship. So, we need a bit of luck from what is happening behind us.\nPRESS CONFERENCE\nQ: Max, very well done. Two laps good enough for pole this evening. Tell us about the performance, first of all. How good was the car? How clean were those laps?\nMV: Yeah, I think in general, qualifying felt a little bit more together compared to the other sessions, where I always felt like we were still lacking a little bit. But then I think with the final changes that we made going into the night, that seemed to help us a bit. And then throughout qualifying, just improving nicely. In Q2, of course, I was on scrubbed tyres, and to be honest, I was a little bit surprised on the first run how much the new tyres actually gave me. But yeah, it was a good lap already, with a little bit of help also from Yuki with a tow. So, that was very nice of him to give up one of his runs. And then the second lap, I was not sure if I was going to improve just because of the tow that I got. But then again, just found a little bit more lap time in the corners, and that gave me a little bit more lap time. So happy with that, happy with the one-lap performance at the end in qualifying. Now, of course, the big question mark is can we keep that up in the race.\nQ: Well, can you? You said that qualifying went better than the practice sessions. Have you got the long-run pace that you need?\nMV: I would hope so. I mean, I actually did a lot of laps in the long run, so we tried to prepare in the best way possible. It's probably the best I have felt, but of course, let's see if that's good enough.\nQ: So, huge race tomorrow. You have your title rivals alongside you and directly behind you. First up, how much are you going relish this battle tomorrow?\nMV: Of course, I'm excited. I'm looking forward to it. I'm going to try to win that race. But of course, with that, I still need a little bit of help or luck to win the championship. But we'll see how that goes tomorrow.\nQ: And how much will you agonise about the different permutations that you need tonight? Just what you need to win the championship—how much will you look to that tonight?\nMV: To think about that tonight? No. We'll figure it out tomorrow, not tonight. I mean, it's like talking about strategy—you can talk about it for one hour, two hours, and then normally after one lap, you throw it in the bin. So, yeah, a lot can go well for you, can go against you, and we'll find out tomorrow.\nQ: Lando, let's come to you. You said a moment ago you're disappointed not to be on pole. So, let's talk about Q3. How was the car? How was your rhythm out there?\nLN: Yeah. I think Q1, Q2, not the smoothest. My Q3 laps, I was pretty happy with, honestly. So yeah, I felt pretty good. I felt like I got a lot out of the car today, but it just wasn't enough. So, a bit disappointed because you just want to be on pole for the final race of the year. But we just didn’t have the pace today. So, I felt like I got the maximum out of the car, and I have to be happy with that. Of course, behind the one person I kind of want to be ahead of—that’s the only reason for the disappointment. But otherwise, I was pretty happy with my laps, and yeah, it was the maximum we could do.\nQ: You used two sets of tyres early on. How much did that upset the rest of the session for you?\nLN: No, it didn’t.\nQ: Let’s throw this forward to the Grand Prix itself. First of all, the long-run pace of the car—what did you learn in Friday practice in particular?\nLN: Bits. I think we weren’t in the best position on Friday. I think we've improved in quite a few areas since then. And race pace, you know, normally we're pretty strong. But like Oscar said, Max’s pace was also very strong. So yeah, I think today when you look at it, we weren’t quite quick enough. But of course, we'll hope we can turn some of that around tomorrow.\nQ: So how do you balance taking risks in this race with protecting your championship lead?\nLN: I'll decide when I have to.\n1 / 5\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Max Verstappen of Oracle Red Bull Racing and The Netherlands celebrates pole position during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Peter Fox/Getty Images)\nQ: Oscar, it was very close between you and Lando in qualifying. Let's talk about your one-lap pace first of all. How pleased were you?\nOP: I think overall, pretty happy. I feel like Q1, that was the first lap that was actually good for the weekend, which was nice to have it at the right time. And then I think the laps in Q3 were pretty good as well. You know, the tiny little margins that you always have on a qualifying lap were probably there, but I didn’t have an answer for Max’s pace today. So ultimately, pretty happy. Would have loved a bit more, but we didn’t have it.\nQ: And are you happy with the long-run pace of the car?\nOP: Difficult to know. I've not done that much long running, obviously only FP2, but it looked okay without being anything spectacular. So yeah, I would have loved the long runs to have gone a bit better, but we're here now, and we'll see how the conditions and the track evolve.\nQ: Now you've won championships before, obviously, as has Lando in the junior formulas. Is there anything you've learned from previous high-pressure moments that will help you tomorrow?\nOP: Yes. Funny things can happen. That’s what I've learned.\nQ: Going to get your popcorn out and watch these two going into Turn 1 tomorrow, for example?\nOP: Turn 1, I don't know, but I'll have someone stand by.\nQUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR\nQ: (Scott Mitchell-Malm – The Race) Question to all three. Based on the long runs in FP2 and how the track has felt through today, how much do you feel it's gripped up from yesterday, and what's that going to do in terms of the demands of the car? Because a lot of people were talking about front graining on the front right and then deg on the rears.\nMV: Normally, it always improves a bit. It's quite natural throughout the weekend. But still, I think everyone in the long runs was graining their right front, and at the same time, the rears are also not on holiday. So yeah, I think we will all struggle with the same thing—but some a bit more than others.\nLN: Max summed it up pretty well. I think the track certainly improves always into qualifying. Probably not as much as we might have thought considering yesterday, with where the fuel loads we were at, things like that. It was already a 23.0, I think. So, we didn’t really go that much quicker today with a lot less fuel. So I maybe would have hoped for a bit more from us today in quali performance. But lately, our quali performances have been something that have been a bit more on the back foot rather than the races. So yeah, like Max says, I think everyone struggled with similar things. But generally, people try and work on those things as much as possible into FP3 and so forth. And normally, the grip coming up then also helps that into Sunday.\nOP: Yeah. I don't have much to add. I think it has gripped up quite a bit. I think for everyone, it was probably a bit worse than expected. So, we'll see what that looks like tomorrow.\nQ: (Carlo Platella – FormulaPassion.it) Question for Max. You mentioned the improvements you and the team made since yesterday. What were the main struggles you experienced yesterday with the car?\nMV: Just being able to put it all together. Sometimes that’s oversteer, sometimes that’s understeer. Just depends a little bit on the corner layout. And every session you try different things—some bits are positive, some bits are negative. And then over the practice sessions, you make a call on what you want for qualifying. That’s what we did, and finally most of the corners came together.\nQ: (Phil Duncan – PA) Max, back in 2016 when Lewis was trying to win the title, he tried to back Nico up into the pack so that he would fall down a few places. Is that a tactic you're considering tomorrow and one you might be up for exploiting? And Lando, are you prepared for what might not be a very straightforward race in that respect?\nMV: Yeah. It was also a different layout. I feel like now you get towed around a lot more around the lap, so it’s probably not as easy to do something like that. Cars also are completely different to back then. I felt like it was a lot easier back then to back it up because the tyres would overheat a lot when you would get close. I remember even in 2016, in some qualifying laps, you couldn’t go flat out in Sector 1 to keep the tyres alive in the last sector—which actually was here, for example. So yeah, very different times. I hope it’s not straightforward, the race—but hopefully that’s not because of me!\nQ: Lando? Are you expecting a complicated race?\nLN: No idea. I expect everything, so we’ll wait and see.\nQ: (Julian Linden – Herald Sun) Question for Oscar. Are you cool with team orders now if you can’t win? And if by chance it turns out that you do something which helps Lando win the championship, how would you hope or expect he might thank you or repay you down the track?\nOP: I don't know. Handshake would be good, probably. I don’t know. I haven't... I don't know what exactly is expected of me yet. But until either Lando or Max cross the line in front of me, I’ve still got a chance of winning the title. So yeah, we’ll see how the race pans out.\nQ: (Laurence Edmondson – ESPN) To Oscar, are you expecting those conversations to happen before the race tomorrow? Is that the normal process? And to Lando, you mentioned on Thursday how much the championship would mean to you—was there any difference in the way you felt ahead of that qualifying session?\nOP: I’m sure we will talk about it. Yes. I think it makes a lot of sense to talk about that one before the race.\nLN: No. I mean, I'm always a bit nervous before quali. It's more excitement than anything else. But apart from Q1, I felt pretty good out there. So no, I felt pretty normal.\nQ: (Tim Hauraney – TSN) Max, where does this qualifying lap from yourself, your final push lap, rank for you all-time, and was it close to perfection from you?\nMV: Yeah. It felt really good, and of course there was quite a bit of pressure trying to do the best we could. It felt probably similar to 2021 qualifying—I had a really good qualifying here as well. But I like that. When the pressure is the highest or when you really need to perform, normally I perform because I enjoy that kind of aspect. But yeah, it was nice. You always try to do the best possible quali lap. Sometimes it works out better than other times. I think this time it worked out pretty well.\nQ: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Lando, in the build-up to Qatar you could have won the championship there on Sunday. How did going through that experience, in terms of nerves, pre-race build-up, help you going into this weekend?\nLN: I mean, it feels a bit different, just because it's the final race of the year, not because of anything else. I felt pretty normal into Sunday last week. I didn’t really have the expectation that I was going to get the championship because I started P3 and just didn’t really expect it. Or P2. So no, I felt good then, I feel good now. I feel comfortable and ready to go. I feel like we’ve got a good plan for things. But as Max said, you can’t plan for everything. So no, I feel good. I feel excited to get the final race done and then go on holiday.\nQ: (Mat Coch – PlanetF1.com) To the two McLaren drivers: tomorrow there's a good possibility that one of you is going to be very happy and one perhaps a little bit less happy. Have you guys discussed that?\nOP: I don’t think you need to have any discussions about things like that. One of us could win our first championship in F1—you’re obviously going to celebrate that. I think we've got more than enough respect between each other to appreciate the work of the person that loses tomorrow, and there’s going to be nothing but respect either way. Also, whoever's on the losing side – it would be unfair to expect the person who’s won to not celebrate. So, I don’t think you need any conversations. I think we’re adults and got enough respect between us to know what’s right.\nLN: Yeah. Oscar said it well. It’s not a conversation that needs to be had, and I think we both understand each other and are respectful enough of one another. I think we both understand that no one would do anything in a bad way to make the other feel worse. We both respect what we do every single weekend, every quali, every race. We go out and race together. But that’s the same off the track—we're two different guys that get along, and that’s all we need.\nQ: (Maria Guidotti – GrainingF1.com) Lando, two questions. Would you sign to finish tomorrow the way you finished today? And in an ideal situation approaching a season, is it better in terms of mindset to be the hunter or the hunted?\nLN: I don't mind either. I’ve been in both positions, I guess. I felt good in both. I performed in both. So yeah, I’m not too bothered to be the hunter or the hunted. I think normally to be hunted is fine because you’re normally the one with the advantage in the first place, so that’s good. And of course, I would sign for that now but life’s not that simple, sadly. So, I’m still going to go into tomorrow and we are still going to plan for how we can win the race, whether it’s on pace or strategy or whatever it may be. That’s all going to be our plan tomorrow, and that’s how I want to end the season—standing on top. So, nothing changes from that side.\nQ: (Dzhastina Golopolosova - Momentum Racing) How much of tomorrow will be decided in the first few corners? And are you ready to take the maximum risk if needed? This question to all three drivers.\nMV: All out. I have nothing to lose. So for me, of course, I’m going to try to win the race. I’m going to defend. If I need to attack, I’ll attack, because what can happen? You’re either second or third – or you win. That would be fantastic.\nLN: I mean, it’s not something you decide now, honestly. It’s something that you'll see and decide before the start of the race and five metre s before you brake into Turn 1. Until then, I think everyone just wants to get the maximum out of it for themselves.\nOP: Yeah. I mean, from where I'm sat, I need things to happen in the race to win the championship. So, I’ll wait and see if those things happen."}

And I'm so proud of everyone.\nQ: Look, it's been an incredible season. It was so tight between you all. You were feisty in that race as well. We were curious to know, would you sit back and not take any risks, but you pulled off some good passes, did what you had to do. How much of that world championship was in your mind when you were running in third and how much is it just in the moment?\nLN: It's a bit of both. I mean, you can't not think of it. But anyway, it's a long race to the very end. You know, we've seen many times anything in Formula 1 can happen, and I just kept pushing until the last two or three laps, [then] I could ease it off a bit, but I was still wanting to fight to the end and that's what we did. That's what we had to do this season, you know, with Max chasing us the whole way, with Oscar catching up again at the end. They certainly didn't make my life easy this year. But yeah, I don't know. I'm happy.\nQ: Understandably so. And, you know, this is a beautiful moment of winning your first world championship. I don't know if you were aware of a moment — we were — you were under investigation with the overtake on Tsunoda where you went beyond the white lines, and of course nothing came of that. But were you aware of it? Did your team tell you? Because we were all on the edge of our seats.\nLN: I had no idea. I had no idea. I didn't care. I mean, I knew what I did was fine so I had nothing to worry about. Yeah. I was just trying to enjoy the moment. You know, there's not many people in the world, not many people in Formula 1 ever get to experience what I've experienced this season and this year. So, I'm happy for everyone. I'm happy for everyone more than me, but yeah, I'm just crazy happy.\nQ: That's wonderful to see. We're looking across, we see Zak Brown, we see your parents, your brother, your family, everyone here who's been on this journey with you. So just once again, are you able to compartmentalise — you are the world champion?\nLN: I mean, look, it's been a long journey with me and McLaren. I've been with them for like nine years and we've been through plenty of crazy difficult times and plenty of good times, you know. So, for me to feel like I can bring something back to them — it's their first Drivers' in many, many years — so I feel like I did my part for the team this year and I'm very proud of myself for that, but I'm even more proud for everyone that I've hopefully made cry.\nPRESS CONFERENCE\nQ: Max, look, very well done. What a race. What a season. How do you reflect on the race and the weekend as a whole? Let's start with that.\nMax VERSTAPPEN: Well, honestly, we maximised everything that we could. We put it on pole, and we won the race. And I think also in the race, we had very strong pace. So, there’s really not much that I could have done different. I think what complicated it a bit was that Oscar was on a different strategy. So, you never know, of course, when he then pits, how much pace he has in hand to catch up again. That also complicates a bit trying to keep the pack together or whatever. But, yeah, overall, just very proud again of the weekend that we had. We put it all out there, and, yeah, the car was actually enjoyable to drive.\nQ: And what about the season as a whole? I mean, think back to Hungary where you finished more than a minute behind the winner, and here you are within two points of the world champion.\nMV: Yeah. Massive rollercoaster for us. Of course, the first half had some nice moments, but mainly tough moments — some really tough races and feelings. But I’m also very proud of how we never gave up. And, again, that’s also a lesson for the future, for everyone, that even when it looks like you’re out of it, you never give up. You keep working hard to try and understand your issues, and then you never know what can happen.\nQ: Final one. A few words from you on our new world champion, Lando Norris.\nMV: Winning your first title is something that I think we all dreamt of when you get into the sport. You work for that since you're a little kid. It’s what you dream of. So, when you win your first title, this is very emotional. And, yeah, I hope for Lando as well. You know, I saw a lot of his family is here, so it’s important to enjoy this a lot as well tonight. Also, with his team. I think, again, that’s another story where it showed that even when you have tough years, when you keep working hard, you keep adding good people to the team, you can overcome all of those things, and you can become very successful again. And, yeah, they had an incredible season together, so it’s important that they enjoy it.\nQ: Oscar, many congratulations on your 16th podium of 2025. You raced hard and fast this evening. How do you reflect on the race and the weekend?\nOscar PIASTRI: I think, honestly, pretty good. There wasn’t anything left out there. Obviously, we tried a bit of a gamble on the strategy to give ourselves some different options and hope that the stars aligned to give ourselves the best chance. But ultimately, in the end, that didn’t happen. So, yeah, I think given as well I missed a practice session, it took a little bit to find my feet. I think that was the maximum we could have achieved today. We didn’t have an answer for Max’s pace. So pretty happy with the weekend. Not much more we could have done.\nQ: And the season as a whole, how do you reflect on that? You led the title longer than any other driver this year.\nOP: Yeah. I mean, I think, obviously, I would have wished for a slightly different ending, but I think this year I’ve learned a hell of a lot about myself as a race car driver, myself as a person. I think if you had presented this season at the start of the year with the pole positions and the wins and the podiums, I definitely would have been pretty happy with that. And I think even in the tough moments, I’ve learned a lot about myself and how I can be stronger in the future. So, I think, ultimately, there’s a little bit of disappointment, obviously, but I think I can be very proud of the season I’ve had and plenty of lessons to take to the future.\nQ: And can we get your thoughts on Lando and the job he’s done this year to be world champion?\nOP: I think a very deserving winner. I know that every weekend I go on track, it’s going to be tough. And I think we’ve pushed each other through the last three years. I think especially this season has been tighter than ever. So, yeah, I think he’s had a great season. Probably all three of us, but obviously, myself and Lando in the same team, in the same car, have had our ups and downs at different moments. Ultimately, I think he’s had a good season and a deserving champion.\nQUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR\nQ: (Scott Mitchell-Malm – The Race). Max, you hinted a little bit at the complication with Oscar’s strategy and how you ran your race. Did you give much thought pre-race or during the race about backing up or trying to impact the flow of the race that way? Or was it more just focus on getting the job done out front?\nMV: I had a lot of scenarios in my head, but then, of course, I knew once the tyres Oscar had on the car, that would be quite difficult. I think we were probably a bit too quick up front. The others couldn’t really follow that well. I think Charles drove his heart out today to try and get onto that podium, so that was also impressive to see. But, of course, they went for a two-stop. I think even that made it more complicated because if you stay on a one-stop, backing the whole thing up is tough. And I think this new layout around here makes it even harder to do that compared to 2016 or whatever.\nQ: (Ben Waterworth – Speedcafe) Oscar, you obviously touched on the disappointment of the season and ultimately not achieving what you were hoping. But do you think, in reflection, you’ll look back at this year as a success? Not to take away from the careers of your other two rivals but neither of them was fighting for a world championship in their third season. You’ve come away with the most ever wins by an Australian in a single season. Can you take that hunger for the title into next year?\nOP: Definitely. I mean, comparing different parts of different people’s careers is always difficult with different cars and stuff. But I think definitely I can be very proud of the season I’ve had. When I look at this season compared to my first two years in F1, this year has been head and shoulders above the first two. Ultimately, whilst the end result is not quite what I wanted, there’s a lot of optimism and a lot of strength that I’ve gained from proving to myself what I can achieve through this season. Those are the kinds of things that are not necessarily tied to results. So I think for me, I can definitely take that forward into the future. It’s only my third attempt at this in F1. Hopefully, I’ve got plenty more to go, but there are definitely lessons from this year that will only make me stronger.\nQ: (Tim Hauraney – TSN) Max, congratulations on the race win. We heard you on the radio to GP. What has he meant to you over your career, in particular this season with all the ups and downs?\nMV: It’s been an emotional year. Forget about the results this year. I also don’t want to go too much into detail, but it’s been tough. But I’m very happy to be able to work with someone that passionate. Of course, he is my race engineer, but I see him as my friend. We have lived through so many emotional things together and fantastic achievements. I’m sure he was a bit emotional after the flag. So, I’m really looking forward to leaving here and catching up with him because it’s not been easy at times for him. I’m just very proud to be able to work with someone that good. A proper example of someone that never gave up this season, even through the difficult times.\nQ: (Ronald Vording – Motorsport.com) Oscar, you mentioned a couple of times that you’ve learned a lot of lessons this year. What have been the most valuable lessons? Is that related to Austin, Mexico, or does it go further?\nOP: Ultimately both, I think. There’ve definitely been lessons directly to do with how I drive the car, how I can be better in different conditions, and just become a better all-round driver. There have also been lessons outside the car — dealing with adversity, dealing with difficult moments. I’ve learned a lot about myself in those kinds of things. So, there have been lessons both in and out of the car that will definitely help me for the future.\nQ: (Julian Linden – Herald Sun) Oscar, 91 days till Melbourne. I’m sure you’re not thinking about it now. What will you do over the summer break to prepare for it? How will you rest and recuperate?\nOP: Yeah, it’s nice having another summer break. I’m going back to Australia for a little bit, see my family and friends, give my annual hellos and goodbyes. I’m looking forward to some time away from racing, to be honest. It’s been a long, demanding season. As enjoyable as driving the fastest cars in the world is, a break now and again is always a nice thing. So, I’m just looking forward to not thinking about race cars and spending time with people around me. Then obviously, the new season is not far away, so it’s going to be important to enjoy that time off and then come back refreshed with the new challenges for next year.\nQ: (Mat Coch – PlanetF1.com) Max, result and championship outcome aside, is this the best that you feel you've ever driven in Formula 1?\nMV: Yeah, I think so. I mean, I have no regrets about my season. I think the performance has been strong. I've hated this car at times, but I've also loved it at times. And I always tried to extract the most from it, even in the difficult weekends that we’ve had. But, yeah, it's been, like I said before, a proper rollercoaster with the car. Luckily, the last, I would say, eight, nine rounds in general have been a lot more enjoyable. And also, in the team, we have a great atmosphere at the moment. We’re really on a roll — positive energy, belief, confidence — and that’s exactly what you want heading into next year.\nQ: (Vincent Sondermeijer - NRC Netherlands) Max, was there a point during the race where you sort of resigned and thought, “Okay, I’m not going to win the title,” or did you keep believing that there might be something happening until the final lap?\nMV: I just kept looking on the screen to see if something would pop up. Yeah, I mean, the race itself went really well, and I was just enjoying sitting in the car and driving it. And every straight you keep looking if something happens, but at the same time, that's part of racing. So I was not really too fussed about it.\nQ: (Tom Cary – The Telegraph) Oscar, you mentioned taking some time. Are you going to get to any of the cricket this winter? Don’t know if you were aware of the result earlier today in the Ashes...\nOP: Oh yes, I am.\nQ: (Tom Cary – The Telegraph) Did you think maybe luck was on your side — Australia gave England an absolute walloping there — and in time for the race as well?\nOP: Yeah, it was nice that the boys could wrap it up before the race started. Hopefully, I will get to some cricket — ideally Boxing Day, given it’s in Melbourne. I mean, there’s part of me that kind of wants the series to still be alive by that point, and part of me that really doesn’t. So I’ll take whatever we can get. It’s been enjoyable to watch for the last couple of weeks.\nQ: (Tom Cary - The Telegraph) Oscar, you’ve been in quite a few championship battles since your career began. Is fighting for an F1 title anything comparable to other championship fights you’ve had?\nOP: I think there are similarities, yes. The emotions you feel are more or less the same. I think what’s different in F1, when I compare it to the junior championships, is the length. The longest junior championship I had was ten rounds. This one has been two and a half times that. The duration you have to live through is much more. My F2 season, for example, was eight rounds., So I think that part is quite different. And I think just the stakes are a little bit different as well. In the junior categories, you obviously want to win the championship, but you’re trying to make your case for why you should be in F1. I think we’ve seen through the years — Max is probably the perfect example — you don’t need to win championships to demonstrate your capabilities for F1. Whereas when you get to F1, there’s nothing more than becoming champion. So that aspect is a bit different, but, yeah, there are also some similarities.\n1 / 5\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Race winner Max Verstappen of the Netherlands driving the (1) Oracle Red Bull Racing RB21 arrives in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Bryn Lennon - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\nQ: (Leonid Kliuev – Grande Premio Brazil) Oscar, how do you think the dynamics will change next year in the team between yourself and Lando? Will it be harder to fight with him now that he’s a reigning world champion?\nOP: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think that will change anything. For me, he’s obviously had a great season this year and a deserving champion, but he’s still Lando Norris. It’s not like he’s become Superman. So, I don’t think things will change with that. I’m expecting full fairness from the team and equality going forward. I don’t have any concerns that that will change at all. Clearly, Lando’s had a very strong season this year, and ultimately did a better job.\nQ: (Jack Smith (Motorsport Monday / MotorsportWeek.com) Max, to follow up on Matt’s question. Given how well you did drive this year and how much ground you made up to take it all the way to this race, can you take as much pride from this season compared to the pride you took from the last four years when you did win the championship?\nMV: I mean, at the end of the day, of course, it’s always nicer to win it. But, honestly, I’m sitting here now with probably a better feeling than what I had last year at this time because the second half of last year was pretty tricky at times as well. So, we have been struggling for, I would say, a year — the second half of last year and the first half of this year. But I actually feel a lot better now. Of course, shame to miss out on the title, but at the same time, for a long period of time I was not even thinking about the title. I never felt like I was in it until a few rounds ago. That’s pretty crazy. But, yeah, you take your pride in different ways. I’m happy with myself and going into next year I’m not in a state of having to worry about my skills or whatever. So, yeah, I feel good.\nQ: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Oscar, just picking up on your point about fairness. McLaren’s got quite a bit of flack at points this year for the papaya rules and the equality between you and Lando. But we’ve got through this season without any major bust-ups and the team achieved the ultimate goal of a McLaren driver winning the title. How much is that testament to the team’s approach and culture?\nOP: I think it is a testament to the way we go racing. Obviously, it’s not easy fighting for both the Constructors’ Championship and the Drivers’ Championship with two very evenly matched drivers. But ultimately, that’s a problem we knew we were going to have. At the end of the day, I think there’s a lot of good things that come from that. Yes, there’s difficult moments and tension at times, but I think both Lando and I have become better drivers from pushing each other to the limit. Sometimes that’s been uncomfortable for everyone, but ultimately, yeah, it’s been a good thing. We’ve had a lot of discussions through the year, and I’m sure we’ll have discussions in the off-season about anything we want to do slightly differently for next year. But I think at the end of the day, they gave us both as good a chance as the team could have to fairly fight for a world championship, and that’s all you can ask for.\nQ: (Giles Richards – The Guardian) Max, you lost out to Lando by just two points. What do you think now about the incident with George Russell in Spain? Do you regret that looking back in hindsight?\nMV: You forget all the other stuff that happened in my season. The only thing you mention is Barcelona. I knew that would come. You’re giving me a stupid grin now. I don’t know. Yeah, it’s part of racing at the end. You live and learn. The championship is one of 24 rounds. I’ve also had a lot of early Christmas presents given to me in the second half, so you can also question that.\nCHAMPION’S PRESS CONFERENCE\nQ: A very warm welcome to the FIA Formula One World Champion Lando Norris. Can you begin to describe how this feels for us?\nLN: I just laugh. It's tough to describe. It's tough to put in words. I mean, I just want to go and spend some time with my team, my engineers, my mom and my dad. I don't know what I'm going to say. So much goes into achieving what we've achieved today. You know, from all those years ago when I saw Formula 1 on the TV, when I saw a go-kart for the first time – my memories the last couple laps were really just that. They took me back to where it all started because I wouldn't be here without my parents and the sacrifice they've done. My brother and my sisters, the amount of times they text me and I don't get back to them. You know, just everything. Everything that leads into achieving what we all achieved today. And this is not my world championship. This is ours. This is one where I get to say, \"Thank you, mom,\" and \"Thank you, dad.\" They're the ones who sacrificed so much to let me be the lucky boy that I am today – to live my dream, to do what I have loved doing since I was a kid, driving that go-kart for the first time at home. The best memories ever, you know. And so much goes into it every year. And for the first time, I really get to say thank you to them, to my parents, to my family. And I get to really make them feel like everything they did was worth it. They might have felt like it was worth it after getting to Formula 1 or getting the first win in Miami. But, you know, the thing that makes me smile every day is making my parents proud, making my friends proud, the people who support me so much through the plenty of tough times I've had this year, celebrate the good times that I've had this year. But I feel like I finally get something to say thank you – not just in words, but in terms of the volume of a championship – that they are just as much a part of as I feel like I go out on track and perform. They're with me through every step of the way. And today, I just get to say thank you to all of them. I get to make them smile. And that’s all I really want in my life is all of them to be happy and to get to celebrate. And that’s what I managed to do for them all today.\nQ: Lando, you were pretty convincing earlier in the weekend when you said you felt relaxed. Was that the reality? Just how tough has this weekend been for you emotionally?\nLN: I've had a lot of tough moments in the beginning of the season. I had great moments – winning the first race in Australia certainly gave me a big boost. But quite quickly, I had not the best run of results, and Oscar did an incredible job, was consistently ahead of me. It got tricky at times. I think at the end of the day, it shows that consistency over a year is what helps achieve what we've achieved today. But those tricky moments, like everyone says, you’ve got to learn from them, acknowledge them, understand them. I've had to go above and beyond in terms of expanding my group, the people I work with on the track, and more so off the track. The amount of people that I have in my corner – not from McLaren but externally: my friends, my family, my coaches, people that help me think in better ways and perform in better ways. So many people allowed me to go out and be more calm and almost try and not acknowledge the pressure or just perform under pressure and have the second half of the season that I had. If I look back on it, my first half of the season – not the most impressive. Certainly, times I made some mistakes, made some bad judgments. I made my errors, as I'm sure every driver would admit to. But how I managed to turn all of that and have the second half of the season that I had is what makes me very proud – that I've been able to prove myself wrong.\nThere were doubts I had in the beginning of the year, and I proved myself wrong. And that's something that makes me very happy. Like I said, this was a moment that I got to thank them all for that – all their hard work, all the stuff that other people do for me. This is my way of saying thank you. But I did feel calm. I felt calm until three corners to go. I started to shake a little bit. I got to think of all those incredible memories very quickly, and then I got to see the team when I went over the line. And this is a moment that I'll never forget.\nQ: Final one from me. Just how do you think you're going to grow as a driver as a result of this championship?\nLN: That I'll find out. You know, I feel proud but not because I'm gonna wake up tomorrow and go, \"I beat everyone.\" I'm not proud because I get to just say I'm a world champion. I'm proud because I feel like I made a lot of other people happy. I made my engineer Will, Jarv as well – they don’t get to see their family much. They've seen me grow up more than they've seen their own kids grow up. I feel bad about that. But the fact that they put so much effort into making me perform and helping us... I'm shaking. Helping us all perform. The fact I get to make them feel like their time has been, hopefully, a little bit worth it—that's what makes me so happy. I hope it doesn’t change anything I do, the way I think, the way I do things. I believe I won the championship this year my way – by being a fair driver, by trying to be an honest driver. At times, could I have been more aggressive and got off the brakes and had a few people over? I certainly could have done, and maybe I would need to do more of that in the future. But did I need to do it this year? Is that the way I want to go racing? Is that me? It's not. And I'm sure if you compare me, if that’s what you wanna do, to all the champions: have I been as aggressive as them at times? No. Have I been as daring as them at times? No. But did I do just what I needed to do to win the world championship? Did I perform consistently? Did I perform when I needed to under the most pressure? Post-Zandvoort, did I come back in the way I had to? Did I have three, four weekends of great results? I did. And I performed when I needed to perform to win the World Championship this season. And in the end, that’s what I needed to do. That’s all I needed to do. Of course, I’ll learn from everything. Like I said, moments I wish I could go back on and I feel bad for, like Montreal and things like that, I embarrassed myself. But I wish I could go back and change some things. Plenty of moments to learn from. I feel like I'm a better driver now, certainly, than I was at the beginning of the season. But everyone’s going to do it. And when I’m racing against Max, a four-time world champion, when I’m racing against Oscar, a guy who at some point in the future will probably beat me and be a world champion, I’m performing. And I’m having to perform against the best in the world. And I look forward to plenty more times like that. And I need to understand what I can do better, how can I do better, how can I perform more consistently against them and learn from them? And I feel like I did that this year, and I've got to do that even more next year if I want to retain what we've been able to achieve this year.\nQUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR\nQ: (Laurence Edmondson – ESPN) Congratulations, Lando. Well done. Fantastic. Just on the Zandvoort thing you mentioned there. Obviously, there you were 34 points behind all of a sudden. Did that actually release some of the pressure and allow you to get more of your true performance from yourself for that period afterwards?\nLN: I honestly would just want to say no. It didn’t allow me to relax. Like, when I see 34 points against a guy who's in the same car, who's doing an incredible job, who I know is incredibly quick, that didn’t fill me with confidence. And it wasn’t like, \"I got nothing to lose now, I can just go.\" I felt like I was trying to do everything I could before, and I continued to try and do everything I could after. But I just had to step up what I was doing away from the track. Like I said before, the people I was working with, I added more people to that group. I had to work harder both on the simulator and here at track. I had to change my approaches. I had to change my... yeah, like a lot of people do. I had to dig deep and try and understand more things quicker and in a more advanced way than I ever have before. That’s what gave me the advantage I had – not, \"Oh, the pressure’s off, I can go and do what I’d like to do.\" It was really the opposite. I was like, \"Oh, shoot. I’m quite a long way behind against a pretty freaking fast driver, and I’ve got to step it up.\" And I got to be more myself because of external factors—working with more professionals in different areas to unlock more of my ability. And I think when you saw that, I had that run of great results, which is ultimately what got me the championship in the end.\nQ: (Phil Duncan – PA) Congrats, Lando, on getting the job done. You've often described Max this year as, you know, the best that there's ever been, you know, almost the GOAT. What does it feel to you to be able to have actually beaten him to win the first world title? And now you've got that one out of the way, do you think more world championships can follow?\nLN: Look. I hate ever having to try and compare myself to other people. This is all for you guys to decide whether someone’s better than someone else or not. All I try and do every weekend is the best of what I can. But then you decide he’s better than him, or he’s got a worse car and he’s doing better – write what you like, decide what you like. I certainly feel like at moments I've driven better than I feel like other people can. And I feel like I drove at a level I don't think other people can match. But have I also made my mistakes? Have I made more mistakes than other people at times? Yes. Is there stuff Max could do better at times than me? Yes. Do I believe he's unbeatable? No. But you also don’t know, do you? It’s hard to know. Like, they also struggled with the car in the mid part of the season. They’ve had an incredible second half of the season. They took advantage of the fact we had two of us fighting for a world championship. He really made the most of that and Max drove like he is a four-time world champion. And I’m very happy that I got to race against him and try to prove myself against him. Whether then you want to write whatever you want to write, against him, against me, or whatever it is, feel free. But I’m not here—honestly, like I said at the beginning—my motivation is not here to prove I’m better than someone else. That’s not what makes me happy. I’m not goping to wake up tomorrow and go, \"I’m so happy because I beat Max.\" I honestly, deep down, don’t care about that. I don’t care if every article is, \"Do you think he’s better than me?\" or \"Oscar’s better,\" or whatever it is. Doesn’t matter. I have no interest in that. I’ve just done what I’ve needed to do to win the world championship. That’s it. And I made my people happy. That’s all I really care about at the end of the day. I’m not going to wake up happy tomorrow because I can just go and say to myself, \"I’m world champion.\" It might make me smile, but it’s not gonna be the truth. It’s gonna be, \"My mom’s happy. My dad’s happy. My sisters are happy. My brother’s happy. My friends are happy.\" And that’s all I need in my life.\nQ: (Scott Mitchell-Malm – The Race) Congratulations, Lando. You mentioned the difficulties in the first part of the year. Just wondered around sort of the first third of the season—did you start to feel like the chance was slipping away at all? And at what point did you start to change things around you? You mentioned additions and who you worked with and whatnot. Did that come later, or were you starting to do things already earlier in the season?\nLN: Honestly, I can’t remember the exact time things started. Certainly levelled up a lot more through the halfway point – around Zandvoort time – but it definitely started prior to that.\nIt started after I had that kind of bad run in race two, three, four, five, six, that kind of area. Or certainly when it was like, \"Alright, my way is not working. I’ve got to understand things differently. I’ve got to speak to more people. I've got to understand what I'm thinking, why I’m thinking it. Why am I doing this? Why am I getting tense in qualifying? Why am I making the decisions that I’m making?\" Whatever it may be. Certainly, the bad run of results and lack of performance—not speed, because I think the speed’s always there—but lack of putting things together when I had the capability of putting things together, allowed or opened up the doors to go and understand: \"Okay, I need to do more than just try again next weekend. I need to try and understand things on a deeper level.\" Mentally. That opened up understanding myself more, understanding things more at a championship level. That’s the level I’ve got to be at.  They are world champions. And yes, certainly the struggles turned into strength. So I would say, if I didn’t have those struggles at the beginning and then had the weakness at the end, would I have caught on to those things as quickly? Probably not. So I was thankful that I had some of the tough moments early on and managed to turn them around. When I got in that kind of good rhythm in the last three months, almost when there’s been more pressure than ever, was almost when I felt most comfortable and most confident into qualifying, you know, I could go from chatting to my engineers and having a fun time with my mechanics to going out and getting pole a few minutes later. So, yeah, the struggle was at the beginning really allowed me to unlock my potential later on.\nQ: (Molly Hudson – The Times) Huge congratulations, Lando. How proud are you not just of in the car, but outside of the car you’ve stayed the same Lando, you’ve still been critical on yourself, you’ve still worn your heart on your sleeve. There’s been a lot of people that have written or said, \"you can’t win a championship like that,\" and you have.\nLN: Thank you. End of. Look, again, that’s one of the things that makes me most proud. I feel like I have just managed to win it the way I wanted to win it, which was not by being someone I’m not. Not trying to be as aggressive as Max or as forceful as other champions might have been in the past – whatever it may be. I’m happy. I just won it my way. I’m happy I could go out and be myself and win it Lando’s way, as Andrea would tell me. That certainly makes me happy. Like I said at the beginning, could I have gone out and been more of that person you probably want me to be at times? I could have done. I would have been less proud about it in some ways. So, that’s why I’m very happy with myself. I kept my cool, I kept to myself, I kept the focus on myself, and I got the most out of how I am. And I know at times I say some stupid things, and I say some things about Max, or I might have said some things at times in the past that everyone talks about, about Lewis. Some things I regret and I wish I could take back and never have come out my mouth. But I honestly believe I give more respect to anyone else than anyone else. I give more respect to Oscar. I give more respect to Max. I try and give as much respect as I can to Lewis—he’s seven-time world champion. He’s the best driver—you compare him to Schumacher—the best driver that’s ever been in Formula 1. I’m not even close to that. I might never be. I dream of those kind of things. I dreamed of today, and I’ve managed to achieve one of seven, comparing to him. And do I regret some of the comments I might have said in cooldown rooms or whatever it is? Yes. But a lot of those are in the heat of the moment. And by the time I’ve said it, I’ve gone, \"Why the hell did I just say that?\" So, I try and be as genuine as I can. I try and always speak the truth. I never try and give you guys false understandings of things. If I think we’re going to win, I’m going say, \"I think we’re gonna win.\" If I think Red Bull are going be fast or probably going to be fast, I’m going to say it. I’m trying to honestly always—I have no gain by trying to hide things from you guys. And, you know, deep down, do I really hate when you write crap about me? I do. It’s also life, and I’ve learned to live with some of those things more. And I also value that everyone has their own opinions—whether they like me or not or think someone else is better or not—like we just spoke about. What I’m happy is that I did things my way this season. I won it in my way, my style of just trying to be a good person and a good team member. And I’m proud about that. No matter what other people want to write about and say about it, no one really knows the truth apart from the people on the inside, in terms of what’s going on.\nAnd I don’t need to listen to those things. So, as long as I know I’ve done a good job, which I have now proven to myself I have, then that’s the only thing I really need to listen to. Is now myself and my team. And that’s all I need.\nQ: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Lando, massive congratulations. In the race itself, how stressful were those moments? Obviously, quite a few, bits of traffic, you had to fight your way through and things like that. What’s your plan to celebrate tonight? Is it just Monster in that glass or anything stronger?\nLN: Hell no! It’s way more! This might be my only time—I really hope it’s not, and I am confident it’s not going be my only time of sitting here alone. It’s quite lonely here. No one else sat by my side.\nBut I want to enjoy this moment because not many people ever will get to experience what I’ve managed to experience today. The effect, the feeling it’s had on other people, that makes me so happy. So I’m going to celebrate. Well. My friends, I really hope they’ve all had many drinks already because I want to go and party with them, because this is more about them than it is about me.\nMy mechanics, my engineers, I mean, crap, we got a test on Tuesday morning, but yeah. I know certainly moments through the race today where I was like, \"Okay, Tsunoda’s up next.\" And we knew from before that Tsunoda might try and do it—try and hold me up and make my life difficult like Perez did to Lewis just a few seasons ago. So a lot of that was in our script and estimations already. But I managed to get through pretty quickly. And it was a bit close. It got pretty close. And it’s crazy thinking about it, because they do think about it straight away. You're like, \"Damn, if that was five centimetres closer—it’s over.\" And that’s when you get to the end of the race—three laps to go, four laps to go—I stopped taking any kerbs because I’m like, if that just makes one piece of the car undo itself, it’s over. That kind of thing. So, I’m like, \"Should I go for fastest lap on the last lap? Maybe.\" It’s not worth it. A lot of those things go through your head. I had to make some fairly decisive overtakes and commit to a few things. But again, the championship was not won today. It was won by my consistency this year, by my great races over the last four months or so. It could have been an easier race. It also could have been a harder race. But sometimes, yeah—it was just another race on the calendar for me. It was a fun race, but I tried to really treat it as, \"Okay, it’s just another race today,\" like I said, and tried to stay calm through it, which I feel like I did, and tried to just maximise my result."}

They deserve better, for sure.”\nOn the other side of the Ferrari garage, Charles Leclerc managed to drag his car into the final Q3 segment and secure fifth on the grid, having made “massive” set-up changes after Friday practice in a bid to find more pace.\n“I’m very pleased with P5,” he said. “It’s a shame to be pleased with P5, but that’s all we had today. I’m satisfied with the performance of today and the laps in Q3.\n“I just hope that next year we’ll start on the right foot, and we’ll be back winning races, because that’s all I want.\n“Let’s say if we look only at this weekend, it’s been a good recovery from the team.

Piastri wound up third overall in the standings , 13 points behind his team mate at the end of a hard-fought season.\nThe result could well have been harder to take for the Australian than for Verstappen – who fell just two points short – given that Piastri led the championship for more races than anyone else. He enjoyed a 34-point lead over Norris after Zandvoort, the 15th race of the 24 Grand Prix season.\nBut Brown is sure his driver will be back even stronger next year and sees no reason to change the status quo within McLaren of letting both drivers race each other week in, week out.\n“He is a future World Champion. Both our guys won seven races, drove brilliantly, they supported each other,” Brown said in the aftermath of Abu Dhabi. “It's a cruel sport, things sometimes go your way, sometimes they don't [in a way that's] out of your control but I'm excited to go racing with these two guys next year.”\nPiastri's season arguably began to unravel after Baku, a weekend where he failed to finish after crashing twice and jumping the start. That then led to a run of five races where he finished off the podium – allowing both Norris and Verstappen to catch and then pass him in the standings.\nAnd while he did not convert a sizeable championship lead into the title in 2025, Piastri at least came back fighting at the end of the season, winning the Sprint in Qatar, while he arguably should have had an eighth Grand Prix victory that weekend as well.\n“I don't think [Piastri] needs to pick himself up. He should be proud. He won seven races, led the championship. Of course, he'll be disappointed, but I don't think there's anything he needs to pick himself up from. I think he just needs to go again,” Brown said.\n“I think we've learnt a lot this year but as far as letting our guys race. We let them race all the way down to the end, including Oscar doing a pass around the outside [on Norris on Lap 1 in Abu Dhabi]. So, we're definitely going to continue with that, but I think like you do every weekend, you learn, you refine.\n“We'll work with the drivers and go, we'll give you equal opportunities or things you want to do differently and the way you do that. We've got two guys capable of winning the World Championship, we'll see what happens next year.”\nWith seven wins apiece in 2026 and separated by just 13 points at the end of a 24-race season, all eyes will be on McLaren in 2026 to see which driver comes out on top in their intra-team fight."}

The two most recent examples where there have been three or more contenders going into the final round were back in 2010 and 2007. So, how did those unfold?\nThere are moments in Formula 1 that hang around in the memory, and those championship deciders are certainly two of them. Both had multiple competitors at varying stages of their careers battling it out to be the world number one – and in the end, neither of those seasons were won by the person leading the standings at the start of the last race.\nThat might not be the best news for Norris , but it gives Verstappen and Piastri more than a glimmer of hope, with a 12 and 16-point gap to the Briton respectively. With that in mind, we take a look at how those previous underdogs clawed their way back to write their names in the history books…\nHow Hamilton, Alonso and Raikkonen kept themselves in the battle in 2007\nAt the beginning of 2007, the grid had already been shaken up with a myriad of driver changes. Some of the most important included Kimi Raikkonen replacing the retiring Michael Schumacher at Ferrari , and reigning champion Fernando Alonso switching from Renault to McLaren where he was partnered by promising young rookie Lewis Hamilton .\nThe Spaniard undoubtedly had the momentum after storming to two consecutive world titles, but it was Raikkonen who took pole and the first victory of the season on his Ferrari debut, kickstarting a fantastic rivalry between the Scuderia and McLaren .\nIn the opening five rounds, the wins were split between the Finn, Alonso and Ferrari’s second driver Felipe Massa, with few people expecting the then 22-year-old Hamilton to seriously challenge his more experienced team mate, despite finishing on the podium in every race.\nIt was in Round 6 that he claimed his maiden victory – after four Safety Cars and a major crash for BMW Sauber’s Robert Kubica, the Briton won at the Canadian Grand Prix and subsequently took the lead of the championship.\nAnother youngster, Sebastian Vettel, joined the grid as Kubica’s replacement, but his arrival – which made waves in the sport for years to come – was somewhat overshadowed by the infamous ‘Spygate’ scandal .\nIn essence, a Ferrari mechanic illegally provided confidential information to an employee at McLaren – you can find more of the gritty details here , but the controversy had a major impact on the season as the Woking outfit were eventually disqualified from the Constructors’ Championship, effectively handing the title to their Italian rivals.\nIt was no secret that in the fallout, Hamilton, Alonso and team boss Ron Dennis weren’t the best of friends, but critically, the drivers were permitted to keep their individual points. Heading into the finale, the Briton narrowly led with a total of 107 points and four wins under his belt.\nAlonso had 104 points, and Räikkönen was a further four behind on 100 – the sole Ferrari contender needed not only one of his best races of the year, but also had to rely on his competitors falling apart.\nWhat happened in the 2007 finale?\nAt the Brazilian Grand Prix – Abu Dhabi didn’t host a finale until 2009 – none of the top three claimed pole position, with Massa instead securing his ninth of the season. Hamilton claimed the next best spot of P2, followed by the Finnish driver in third and Alonso in fourth to ensure that it was very much all to play for.\nThe Ferrari pair got a much better launch at lights out, allowing Räikkönen to charge past the Briton before Alonso did exactly the same thing. An attempt to repass his team mate saw Hamilton lock up and drive wide, rejoining the track in eighth place. But his reputation for fighting back through the field didn’t come from nowhere – he overtook Jarno Trulli and Nick Heidfeld within seven laps before disaster struck.\nHis McLaren began to painfully slow down as the gearbox failed, and over perhaps the slowest 30 seconds of his career, he fought to bring the car back to life. Eventually, Hamilton was able to reset the machine and get going again, but by that point he found himself in P18.\nFrom Lap 20, the frontrunners began to pit, ending with Massa leading Räikkönen by a few seconds, with Alonso 17 seconds further behind. Hamilton was gradually gaining after choosing to go for a risky three-stop strategy, but he was still over a minute off P1.\nThe second round of pit stops proved to be pivotal as Räikkönen overcut Massa by stopping three laps later and emerging in the lead of the race. With the final laps approaching, the Ferrari pair continued to extend a comfortable margin over Alonso and were eventually seen lapping Hamilton.\nOne lap to go and the Briton got another position, improving to seventh place, but it was too little too late. Räikkönen took the chequered flag after a gripping 71 laps, winning the championship by a single point over both Hamilton and Alonso.\nMassa was second, securing a fourth 1-2 finish for Ferrari, and Alonso staggered into third over 57 seconds behind the victor.\nA record-breaking fight between Alonso, Webber, Vettel and Hamilton in 2010\nIf you thought a three-way battle for the title was dramatic, how about four? For the first, and currently, only time in F1 history, a quartet of drivers were up to be crowned world number one in the final round of the 2010 season.\nThree years on from his 2007 loss, Alonso changed his allegiance to Ferrari and just like Räikkönen before him, won on his debut. Unexpectedly, he owed the victory to Red Bull hotshot Vettel, who was dominating at the season opener in Bahrain until a spark plug issue brought his race to a premature end.\nIt was a similar story in the next round at Albert Park – the German driver took pole position and was well on his way to his first win of the season, but this time it was a brake problem that saw him retire from the race. Despite his misfortune, he was still doing a pretty good job of showing up his team mate Mark Webber, who started the year with an underwhelming eighth and ninth.\nIt didn’t take too long for their rivalry to dramatically grow as the Aussie became fired up when he charged to P2 behind Vettel at the Malaysian Grand Prix, motivating him to improve to the top step in Spain and Monaco.\nThe tension between the pair was palpable, so it seemed somewhat inevitable when they finally collided in Turkey.\nWhile their intra-team battle was boiling over, Alonso and Hamilton were gradually ticking off the rounds, albeit with some fairly inconsistent performances. Everything from strategy and illegal passes to costly crashes and mechanical failures plagued their seasons, but the points nevertheless kept going up and up.\nAs a result, no one really emerged as the obvious favourite for the championship, but over time both the bad luck and victories were shared between the four contenders, so much so that they arrived in Abu Dhabi with 24 points separating them.\nAlonso was in the lead with 246 points, hungry to claim a third title. Webber and Vettel had just seven points between them, with the Aussie ahead on 238. And never to be ruled out, Hamilton began the final round with 222 points, still mathematically in the fight.\nWhat happened in the 2010 finale?\nJust like 2025, there were a range of permutations – second place would be enough for the Spaniard to win for Ferrari, and he was undoubtedly in the best form having secured 105 points over the prior five rounds, more than any other driver.\nWebber needed to win and see Alonso cross the line in third or lower, while Vettel depended on the Ferrari finishing sixth. Meanwhile, Hamilton faced the most unlikely scenario as he was required to win while his three rivals failed to score, and even then he would only take the championship by a single point.\nThe Yas Marina Circuit isn’t particularly known for its overtaking opportunities, which was great news for Vettel as he secured an all-important pole position. But his competition wasn’t far behind as Hamilton, Alonso, Jenson Button and Webber lined up just behind him on the grid.\nLuckily, Vettel got a strong start and led the field well while Alonso dropped to third. It then didn’t take long for the Safety Car to be deployed as Michael Schumacher spun out of the race and Force India’s Vitantonio Liuzzi ploughed into him, slowing down the pack.\nThe pit stops proved to be crucial in this race as Webber boxed on Lap 11 and managed to evade an overcut from Massa, but couldn’t find a way past Alonso, who himself got stuck behind Vitaly Petrov and Nico Rosberg.\nWhile he fought to pass the pair, Vettel and Hamilton continued to extend the gap at the front before they both changed their tyres, with the Red Bull driver remaining ahead. He only had to overtake Button, who had yet to stop, while Hamilton had both Kubica and Kamui Kobayashi in front of him.\nOnce Button pitted, Vettel was able to make the most of the clean air and eventually crossed the line 10 seconds ahead of Hamilton, but faced an agonising wait while the others caught up. Finally, after what felt like an age for 23-year-old, the iconic radio message “Du bist Weltmeister!” rang out, confirming that Alonso and Webber had finished the race in P7 and P8.\nThe German hadn’t led the standings at any stage that season, and yet he beat Alonso to the crown by four points.\nIt took two rounds for Räikkönen to overturn what was a 17-point advantage for Hamilton in 2007. It took Vettel one to recover the 15-point gap to claim his first title in 2010 and set himself on the path to three more.\nIf they could do it, can Verstappen? Can Piastri? It’s easy to get caught up in the permutations, but the important thing is it all comes down to one final race. We've seen it happen before, and it's not something you want to miss."}

Hold your head up high.”\nVerstappen was heard to say in response: “We showed them one final time who’s boss! Congrats guys, what a comeback in our second half of the season. We can be really, really proud of that so don’t be too disappointed. I’m definitely not disappointed. I’m really proud of everyone to never give up.”\nAfter the race, Verstappen reflected further on what his relationship with Lambiase means to him, particularly after an eventful season of highs and lows.\n“It’s been an emotional year,” the 28-year-old explained. “Forget about the results this year. I also don’t want to go too much into detail, but it’s been tough. But I’m very happy to be able to work with someone that passionate.\n“Of course, he is my race engineer, but I see him as my friend. We have lived through so many emotional things together and fantastic achievements. I’m sure he was a bit emotional after the flag.\n“So, I’m really looking forward to leaving here and catching up with him because it’s not been easy at times for him.\n\"I’m just very proud to be able to work with someone that good. A proper example of someone that never gave up this season, even through the difficult times.”"}

I certainly could have done, and maybe I would need to do more of that in the future. But did I need to do it this year? Is that the way I want to go racing? Is that me? It's not.\n“And I'm sure if you compare me, if that’s what you wanna do, to all the champions: have I been as aggressive as them at times? No. Have I been as daring as them at times? No. But did I do just what I needed to do to win the World Championship?\n“Did I perform consistently? Did I perform when I needed to under the most pressure? Post-Zandvoort, did I come back in the way I had to? Did I have three, four weekends of great results? I did. And I performed when I needed to perform to win the World Championship this season. And in the end, that’s what I needed to do. That’s all I needed to do.”\nNorris acknowledged that there were certain moments during the season that he would approach differently in hindsight – including his collision with Piastri at the Canadian Grand Prix – but the McLaren racer added that he believes he has improved as a driver since the campaign kicked off in Australia back in March.\n“Of course, I’ll learn from everything,” he admitted. “Like I said, moments I wish I could go back on and I feel bad for, like Montreal and things like that, I embarrassed myself. But I wish I could go back and change some things.\n“Plenty of moments to learn from. I feel like I'm a better driver now, certainly, than I was at the beginning of the season. But everyone’s going to do it.\n“And when I’m racing against Max, a four-time World Champion, when I’m racing against Oscar, a guy who at some point in the future will probably beat me and be a World Champion, I’m performing, and I’m having to perform against the best in the world. I look forward to plenty more times like that.\n“I need to understand what I can do better, how can I do better, how can I perform more consistently against them and learn from them? And I feel like I did that this year, and I've got to do that even more next year if I want to retain what we've been able to achieve this year.”"}

An eventful season for Norris has also brought with it some fascinating statistics – and we’ve rounded up some of the key numbers below…\n-- 0.698 --\nThe smallest winning margin in seconds of all of Norris ’ victories, with this one occurring during his fifth triumph of the campaign in Hungary.\nA one-stop strategy had helped Norris to get into the lead of Round 14 on the calendar, having lined up behind Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc and the other McLaren of Oscar Piastri . However, a charging Piastri started to hunt Norris down during the latter stages, setting up a thrilling end to the race .\nWhile he made a couple of attempts to overtake, Piastri ultimately could not find a way past his team mate – but crossed the line a mere 0.698s behind.\n-- 2 --\nThe number of points by which Norris took the Drivers’ Championship ahead of closest rival Max Verstappen .\nAfter retaking the lead of the standings following the Mexico City Grand Prix, Norris further strengthened his advantage to 24 points over Piastri at the next round in Sao Paulo. Verstappen, meanwhile, was 49 points adrift at this stage.\nHowever, a run of victories for the Dutchman – coupled with some trickier weekends for McLaren – saw him overtake Piastri for second following the penultimate round in Qatar, putting him only 12 points away from Norris for the finale. Another triumph for Verstappen in Abu Dhabi gave him a further 25 points – but Norris just clung on to win the title, ending the season only two points clear of the Red Bull man.\n-- 6 --\nFastest laps achieved by Norris across the season.\nA rule introduced in 2019 saw the driver that scored the fastest lap of the race awarded an additional point. While this was scrapped ahead of the 2025 campaign, setting the quickest time is still something of an accolade.\nNorris racked up six fastest laps during his title-winning season, with his first coming during his victory at the first race of the championship in Australia while his last occurred at the Italian Grand Prix in September.\n-- 7 --\nNorris’ total number of wins – and pole positions – from the 24-race campaign.\nSeven appears to be the magic number for both Norris and team mate Piastri in 2025; incredibly, each driver claimed seven race victories each, as well as both racking up the same number of poles.\nWhile the majority of Piastri’s triumphs took place during the first half of the year, Norris’ were slightly more evenly spread, having stood on the top step of the podium in Australia (Round 1), Monaco (Round 8), Austria (Round 11), Great Britain (Round 12), Hungary (Round 14), Mexico (Round 20) and Sao Paulo (Round 21).\n-- 8 --\nThe number of race weekends where Norris arrived as the championship leader.\nAs touched on above, Norris kicked off the season in style by winning the Australian Grand Prix, meaning that he took an early lead in the Drivers’ Championship standings. From there the Briton continued to head the table – until Piastri overtook him after Round 5 in Jeddah.\nDespite the Australian remaining ahead of the pack for much of the campaign, a strong run for Norris saw the 26-year-old retake the P1 spot thanks to a dominant victory at Round 20 in Mexico – and the rest is history...\n-- 13 --\nHow many times Norris beat Piastri in the intra-team heads-to-heads.\nIn terms of Qualifying trim for the season, Norris narrowly outscores his team mate by 13-11. As mentioned above, both drivers took seven pole positions – but Norris more frequently placed ahead across the campaign as a whole.\nThe race day head-to-head between the two looks very similar, with Norris again just edging it by 13-10 (not including the Las Vegas Grand Prix, in which both McLaren cars were disqualified for a technical infringement).\n-- 17 --\nNumber of years since McLaren last had a Drivers’ Champion prior to Norris’ success.\nWhen the papaya squad won the Teams’ Championship in 2024, it marked the end of a long wait to return to title glory , with their last triumph having occurred back in 1998. Their most recent Drivers’ title, meanwhile, had been won by Lewis Hamilton in 2008.\nThis year McLaren did the double, wrapping up the Teams’ crown early in Singapore before Norris brought home a long-awaited Drivers’ Championship at the finale, ending the 17-year dry spell since Hamilton’s success.\n-- 18 --\nThe number of times that Norris stood on the podium in 2025.\nAlong with his aforementioned seven wins, the new World Champion also crossed the line in second on eight occasions, as well as taking third place three times – one of which being his crucial title-sealing result in Abu Dhabi.\nWith there being a total of 24 races on the calendar this year, this statistic means that only six of these ended with Norris finishing off the rostrum; two being a DNF (in Canada and the Netherlands), one a DSQ (in Las Vegas), while his other non-podium finishes were a P4 in Saudi Arabia, seventh place in Azerbaijan and another fourth at the penultimate event in Qatar.\n-- 30.324 --\nThe largest winning margin in seconds from Norris’ season, achieved during his dominant victory in Mexico City .\nArriving into the weekend at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, the British driver had been without a P1 finish since the Hungarian Grand Prix almost three months earlier – but he soon boosted his chances of changing that statistic by grabbing a stunning pole position in Qualifying.\nFrom thereon Norris raced to a lights-to-flag triumph, crossing the line with a whopping lead of 30.324s over Leclerc in second place.\n-- 35 --\nThe number World Champion that Norris becomes in Formula 1 history.\nPrior to the 2025 campaign, 34 drivers had achieved the dream of winning the title in the top echelon of motorsport; from the very first won by Giuseppe ‘Nino’ Farina in 1950, through to the four in a row scored by Verstappen between 2021 and 2024.\nNorris’ win means that he becomes the 35th on the list of F1 World Champions – and he’ll doubtless be keen to add more than one championship victory next to his name in the future.\n-- 423 --\nTotal number of points scored by Norris by the end of the season.\nEntering into 2025, the highest number of points available to a driver stood at 648 – but to achieve this would require victory in all 24 races plus the six Sprints.\nNorris ended the campaign with a final total of 423, meaning that he scored 65.3% of the points on offer."}

His 12-point lead means that all he needs to do is finish on the podium, whereas Piastri would need multiple things to go wrong for his rivals in order to take victory.\nThey undoubtedly have an advantage by having both drivers starting towards the front of the grid as Verstappen’s departing team mate Yuki Tsunoda , who assisted by giving him a tow in Qualifying, will be much further behind in P10.\nReflecting on the session, Brown told F1 TV : “I feel good. We’ve got a good race car for tomorrow. Get a good start tomorrow, good first lap, things settle in. I think we’ve got a little advantage when it comes to strategy and we’ll see what happens. It’s going to be a nail-biter.\n“I think Lando’s disappointed he didn’t get pole, and Oscar’s disappointed he didn’t get pole. I think there were maybe some little nerves at the start in Q1, but then everything settled down and it was business as usual.\n“Max put in two spectacular laps – he was concerned about the tow that he got from Tsunoda but he didn’t need it the second time around. Hopefully they dialled in a one-lap wonder and they’ll pay the price tomorrow, but I’m not so sure that’s the case.”\nThe prospect of deploying team orders to secure the title has reared its head multiple times going into this weekend – on Thursday’s media day, Norris mentioned that no discussions had taken place, but Brown quickly confirmed that they would be willing to utilise them.\nThey have been a constant sticking point for the Woking outfit over the last two seasons, with their unrelenting focus on fairness occasionally creating tension, such as in Monza when the Australian was asked to let his team mate through after he suffered a slow pit stop.\nNevertheless, Brown appeared confident that their approach will not change for the finale, and extensive conversations about all the possible scenarios that could unfold in the 58-lap race will take place.\nAsked to elaborate on how those necessary talks will take place, he replied: “We’re going to have them tonight and then again in the morning. We’re going to have an initial chat tonight then sleep on it, but it’s all to play for so I think going into tomorrow, it’s the obvious ‘don’t trade any paint’ as they say in NASCAR land.\n“See how the race plays out, and if it becomes apparent that one or the other is in a position where they can or can’t win, then we’ll look at strategy. I think sitting here right now, it’s all to play for. It’s go, go, go.\n“You’ve got two guys going for the championship so I’m sure Oscar’s mindset is ‘I need to win’. If he wins, that takes points off Max which means Lando doesn’t even need to finish third. There are two different mindsets, but the field is so close.\n“I think the minute you’re not fully on it or if you’re too conservative, you’ll get swallowed up by the cars behind because it’s so close. I think it’s kind of business as usual – that’s got to be the approach.\n“Max is a smart racing driver, not only fast, so we’ll be ready for all the different scenarios.”"}

I didn't think I'd cry but I did,” the 26-year-old said. “It's a long journey. First of all I want to say a big thanks to my guys, everyone at McLaren . My parents... I'm not crying. My mum, my dad, they were the ones who supported me since the beginning.\n“It feels amazing. Now I know what Max feels like a little bit, and I want to congratulate Max and Oscar, my two biggest competitors all season. It's been a pleasure to race against both of them, and I've learnt a lot from both of them as well.\n“I've enjoyed it, it's been a long year but we did it and I'm so proud of everyone.”\nReflecting further on how it feels to claim his debut title following a hard-fought campaign, Norris – who arrived in F1 with McLaren in 2019 after joining the squad’s Driver Development Programme two years earlier – added: “It's incredible. Pretty surreal.\n“I've dreamed of this for a long time, everyone does. A lot goes into a season like this, lot of ups, lot of downs, but none of that matters as long as you try and come out on top, and that's what we managed to do with an incredible team.\n“All the boys and girls that I've enjoyed so many moments with. It's not just this year, it's been over the last seven, eight years I've been with McLaren. The last 16, 17 years of my life I've been trying to chase this dream and today we all did it, so I'm pretty happy.”\nSunday’s race at the Yas Marina Circuit was not necessarily all smooth sailing for Norris, who was overtaken by Piastri on Lap 1 and later had to get past the likes of Red Bull ’s Yuki Tsunoda .\nWhen asked how much the World Championship had been on his mind during the Grand Prix – or if he was focused on the moment – the British racer said: “Bit of both. You can't not think of it.\n“I knew it was a long race to the very end, we've seen many times anything in F1 can happen and I just kept pushing until the last two or three laps [where] I could ease it off a bit, but I still wanted to fight to the end.\n“That's what we did, what we had to do this season for Max chasing us the whole way, for Oscar catching up at the end. They certainly didn't make my life easy this year, but I'm happy.”\nNorris also admitted that he had “no idea” that he was under investigation for his move on Tsunoda, to which the stewards subsequently deemed that no further action was required, before adding: “I didn't care, I knew what I did was fine so I had nothing to worry about.\n“I was just trying to enjoy the moment. Not many people in the world, in F1, get to experience what I've experienced this season and this year. I'm happy for everyone more than me. I'm just crazy happy.”\nAs he becomes the 35th Formula 1 World Champion in history, the new title-holder summarised: “It's been a long journey with McLaren.\n\"I've been with them for like nine years, we've been through plenty of crazy difficult times and plenty of good times.\n“For me to feel like I could bring something back to them, it's their first Drivers' [title] in many, many years, I feel like I did my part for the team this year and I'm very proud of myself for that, but I'm even more proud for everyone that I've hugged and made cry.”"}

With the McLaren man needing to finish on the podium to take the title, Leclerc’s presence certainly caused some stress for the papaya team, but when his attempt at an undercut failed, Norris was able to pull away.\nThat left Leclerc a somewhat lonely fourth for the rest of the race, despite brief periods here he was able to close down Norris – but never enough to get back within DRS range of his quarry. While fourth is a decent result, Leclerc was hoping for more not just from the race, but the season as a whole.\n“I gave it everything and our team executed the race perfectly. Unfortunately, P4 was all there was in it for us today,” Leclerc said after the race.\n“I really wanted to finish the season on a high, bringing home a podium for everyone, and I was close to Lando in a few moments of the race, but it was not enough to make a pass.”\nLeclerc was unable to hide his “disappointment” in a season that yielded no Grand Prix wins for Ferrari , although Lewis Hamilton did record one Sprint victory. Leclerc delivered one pole across the season, and seven podiums as he finished fifth in the Drivers’ Championship .\n“I am very disappointed, very disappointed because in general once you are in the heat of the season, race after race, you try and keep your head high. You try and stay motivated, smile and think about the positives.\n“But when the season ends, that’s where the disappointment is getting to me on a season like that. And I just need a few weeks' break, recharge the batteries and go again for next year. But it is the way it is, at least we finish on a slightly more positive note which is a good thing always.\n“But the disappointment of the season is quite big.”\nFerrari finished fourth in the Constructors’ , with their form very hit and miss throughout the season. The good news for the team is that the switch to focus on the 2026 car took place relatively early, meaning resources were diverted and what that cost the Scuderia in 2025 could be made up for with a strong challenge next season.\n“The season has been very tough, true,” added Leclerc. “But there is still a lot of motivation as we think there is a big opportunity next year. So, it is up to us to take that opportunity, and we are working flat-out to achieve that. So, I hope that Ferrari will finally get back on top.”\nLeclerc can at least take heart from out-performing his new team mate, scoring 86 more points than Hamilton across the year as both drivers turn their attention to a new era of F1 cars."}

It’s an amazing comeback, an amazing win.\n“A dominant win today in a clean race. It’s not a track where we were expecting to dominate, but that’s what the guys with Max have been able to do, to come up with a super-fast car here. Very, very proud of the amazing job everyone in Milton Keynes has done to give us not only that race but a sensational comeback in the second part of the year.\n“Well done to Lando, it was a tough but a great fight. I hope it was great as well for the fans to have this championship still open up until the end of the year, the very last lap of the last race. And that’s it, we’ll try harder next.”\nPushed on whether he felt that more could have been done in the Grand Prix to secure the championship for Verstappen, Mekies responded: “No, really I don’t think so.\n“It was the most perfect race in terms of how the team and Max have managed it from the start – from the pole of yesterday, starting from a difficult Friday to a dominant pole yesterday, leading pretty much from the beginning to the end, super good tyre management.\n“I don’t think there is anything better than that. We cannot control what’s happening behind. We just look at ourselves, and I don’t think we could have done anything better today.”\nOn the other side of the garage, Yuki Tsunoda – in his last race for Red Bull before becoming a reserve driver for the team in 2026 – received a five-second time penalty for making more than one change of direction whilst defending against Norris during a scrap with the McLaren .\n“It was a surprise,” Mekies said of the penalty. “But it’s always the hardest job in the world for the stewards to come up with something in some situations. It was a surprise, but ultimately it did not affect the result of the championship, so we just keep the win and well done to Lando for the title.”\nWith the race at the Yas Marina Circuit bringing the curtain down on an eventful 24-race campaign, Mekies expressed his pride at what Red Bull have been able to achieve during the season.\n“It’s always full of emotion,” the Frenchman conceded. “I think the first dominant feeling is that we got a sensational turnaround, something that you don’t see every year, probably you don’t see every decade, and that’s what the girls and the guys have done.\n“So that’s the main feeling – very, very proud, very impressed by this team that never ever gave up on this season, and it was pure racing spirit up until the last lap. We are missing two points, but it doesn’t change how extraordinary this turnaround has been.”"}

Max did a pole [lap] twice today, on both his runs in Q3. It was an unbelievable performance.\n“Very, very proud of the team – we were not the fastest car out there yesterday, and we finished yesterday nearly four tenths off McLaren on the short runs.\n“Of course it’s difficult to read the Fridays, but the car really has improved compared to where we were yesterday, certainly in Qualifying conditions, so big credit to everyone back at the factory and at the track to have nailed the right window for our car today and extracted everything and more.\n“Both drivers did a fantastic job, both cars in Q3, Yuki helping with a tow on the first run and Max posting two unbelievable laps, so very happy. No points for Saturday, but we can now concentrate on trying to extract everything we can for the race pace.”\nIn terms of how the Milton Keynes-based outfit are approaching Sunday’s decisive race, Mekies outlined that the team will “concentrate on ourselves”.\n“The focus now will go simply in trying to see what can we do to extract the last half a tenth of race pace tomorrow, based on what we have learned today,” the Frenchman explained. “As you know there is a limited amount of things we can do on the car, but that’s all we will be focusing on.\n“And the rest, we don’t control what’s behind us, so what matters is that we go tomorrow in the race with the fastest race car possible. It’s a track where you can overtake, so it will be dominated by pure race pace tomorrow.”\nAnd as they head into a season finale where the World Championship is on the line, Mekies spoke of the atmosphere within Red Bull as being “fantastic”.\n“You have to remember, we work all our lives to be involved in this sort of championship finale,” he conceded. “It doesn’t happen every year, to have that sort of level of intensity, that sort of level of competitiveness, and it’s great for everyone.\n“We are all passionate about the sport, and whatever happens in the race tomorrow, it’s a sensational end of the season for the team. They should be proud, and we’ll give it the best possible go tomorrow.”"}

The second half of the season I've really been able to show to myself what I could do, what I was capable of doing.”\nHis turnaround at the Monaco Grand Prix saw him take a spectacular last-gasp pole position, putting him on track to finish the year with seven poles, seven race wins and 423 points to become McLaren’s first drivers’ champion since Lewis Hamilton back in 2008.\nHe couldn’t afford to let up at any stage, especially after he reclaimed a narrow championship lead at the Mexico City Grand Prix in commanding fashion, giving him the most to lose in the final rounds.\nNorris handled the pressure of having two extremely close rivals who he admitted were “pretty freaking fast and certainly made my life tough”, and he did exactly what was necessary in Abu Dhabi to secure the minimum result for him to take the title.\n“Oscar the whole way since Round 1, I knew he was probably going to be the toughest guy to beat and then you can never count out Max – he's Max,” he explained. “We certainly never counted him out – for anyone who might have done, he proved you wrong.\n“I'm glad we kept ourselves on our toes and we were ready for such a thing. It was a pleasure to fight Max, four-time World Champion, so for me to have those fights against him and enjoy those moments, maybe not always enjoy them but some of them.\n“But just to share the track and fight against another World Champion like him and certainly Oscar as well, who will be a World Champion. I really enjoyed this season because of that. As much as they made my life hell a lot of the time, those moments I almost enjoyed the most.”"}

It's all my mechanics, my engineers, everyone that's part of McLaren gets to have that acknowledgement too.\n\"So, it's not for me, it's for them as well. It's their pride, knowing that they put a lot of work and effort into everything that they can also go 'we're number one'.\n\"It's not as cool when you say 'we are number four' so they will be even happier than I am!\"\nSince 2014, F1 drivers have been allowed to pick a number that would stick with them for their careers. In that time Lewis Hamilton was the only World Champion to decline to run the number 1 – with the choice being given to the driver. Instead, he always stuck with his own race number 44.\nVerstappen previously raced under ‘33’ before becoming World Champion, but it remains to be seen if he will return to that number or apply to change for 2026.\nAs for Norris, he will roll out for pre-season testing next year with a new car, a new number and a new-found confidence as the reigning Formula 1 World Champion."}

Norris proved to be his closest challenger, but at 0.201s adrift could not beat the Dutchman, meaning that the championship leader will line up in second on the grid.\nReflecting on the session straight after jumping out of the car, Norris explained: “It’s tough. It’s tough. Max did a good job, so congrats to him. We did everything we could. I think my lap was pretty good, I was pretty happy.\n“Of course I’m disappointed not to be on pole for the final weekend, but we just weren’t fast enough today, so we’ll have to try and do it tomorrow.”\nSharing further thoughts later on, the 26-year-old suggested that the outcome of Qualifying “could have been a lot worse”, adding: “I expected it to be a lot closer into Q3, and the Quali battle then was between me and Oscar.\n“Max was too far ahead – they were too fast. We didn’t quite have the speed in the car today. A tough one to take, but otherwise I think we got everything out of it. I think Oscar said he did a pretty good lap and I thought I did a pretty good lap. Just not fast enough come Qualifying, but tomorrow’s a new day.”\nWhen asked how he is feeling about Sunday’s race – one in which he could potentially win his first title – Norris said: “Remarkably normal. I guess I feel the same, a little bit disappointed we couldn’t get first, even though it was just out of reach today.\n“It’s just always nice to end the season on top like we did last year. We didn’t win the [Drivers’] Championship last year, but it was just nice to end with a win. That’s what I would like to do tomorrow, in either our cases. I feel good, and we’ll go in and do everything the same as normal.”\nA podium would be enough for Norris to be confirmed as World Champion , regardless of where Verstappen and Piastri finish. However, when quizzed on whether he would simply aim for the rostrum or target victory instead, the British driver remained unsure.\n“I don’t know. The time will come that I think of that,” he explained. “For now, I’m disappointed to not be on pole, and I still want to try and win tomorrow, so that’s going to be the goal.”"}

It’s been a long time and a difficult season, and in the middle when we dipped below.\n“But it’s a long journey, it’s a difficult journey. There’s a lot of pain involved in getting there – painful days and long days and sacrifices, and now we’re there. Champion of the world, it’s cool.”\nWhile finishing in the top three was enough to guarantee Norris the title, that result did not always look certain at stages of the Grand Prix, with Norris having to overtake cars following his pit stop which included a close battle with Red Bull ’s Yuki Tsunoda .\nWhen quizzed on how his heart rate was as he watched on through all of that, Adam Norris smiled: “It was actually really good. For the first time all year, I locked myself in a room, I watched it without commentary, and I just sat there with the headphones on and very quietly watched the whole thing.\n“The commentary gets you excited, so when I’m at home I get really excited! My heart rate’s going through the roof, so my thing was, ‘Can I listen to some classical music?’. And you know, if he’d had a puncture he wouldn’t have got there.”\nThe elder Norris paid tribute to the “good team” around his son, before conceding that the achievement might take some time to sink in.\n“I think it will do,” he admitted. “But I love the journey, and I really loved those places you go to that no tourist would go to. You go to remote little tracks, and I love the journey – I really enjoyed every part of that journey, but it was hard, really difficult.\n“Some of the other parents packed up because they didn’t want to do that, but I was there and the team was there the whole way through to keep going.”\nAnd when asked what he said to Lando as they embraced following his triumph, Norris senior said: “I can’t swear, but just 'champion of the world'. You can never take it away – if someone’s won that, you can never take it away. It’s a big day.”\nIt was also a momentous occasion for Norris’ mum, Cisca Wauman, who summed up her feelings to Sky Sports F1 as: “Emotionally drained, but very happy. Very happy for the family, for the team, McLaren, the fans, because they’ve been always there.”\nWauman echoed Adam Norris’ comments about the journey up until this moment, explaining that there have been “a lot of sacrifices” along the way.\n“When Lando was seven, he started karting; by the time he was eight he was competing together with his brother Ollie, and it took the two boys one direction and the two girls I have the other direction,” she reflected.\n“So I missed Lando and Ollie, seeing them growing up as kids. Suddenly playing with a tractor naked in the garden was done, and I missed that! But this is amazing, this is fantastic.”\nAs the race moved closer to its finish, Wauman spoke of the tension that she felt, adding: “Those last laps, they took ages! You never know [what can happen], until the race is done.\n“They were calling us down because me and Adam were sitting in a room separately, and they were calling us down with 10 laps to go – the race is not over, how can they call us down getting ready for this!

That relationship, and their trust in each other, was crucial in Norris claiming F1's ultimate prize.\nWith Max Verstappen winning the season finale, Norris took the third place that he needed to guarantee the title, eventually triumphing by two points over the Red Bull man.\nHad he dropped behind Charles Leclerc, the Championship would have belonged to his rival and, given how quick the Ferrari driver was at times, it added a stressful element to proceedings – something Joseph acknowledged.\n“I think Lando seemed more comfortable than we were!” Joseph explained to F1 TV . \"We sort of knew how much pace Lando thought he had in hand. At one point we just said okay enough is enough [with Leclerc], just use the pace to get away because this is stressing us out too much.\n“I think Lando did a great job, he must have felt comfortable until we gave him the hurry up… You know, I didn’t get a lot of sleep last night. We were going over all the possibilities, the what ifs, the buts, what if [Verstappen] does this, what if he does that.\n“I think we came really well prepared, there were a lot of strong discussions last night and this morning, and it has proved us well. McLaren are very good at preparing. Some people judge us for it, some people say we talk too much on the radio.\n\"But we prepare well, we go well, we discuss things and it’s gone well, we won the Constructors’ back in Singapore and today we made history again with Lando and I’m very proud to be a part of it.”\nJoseph also went on to explain that Norris – who is now the 35th F1 World Champion and the 11th to hail from Britain – has made the team “stronger and stronger” by pushing them, after years of McLaren focusing on the driver’s own development.\n“Each year you get better and better and we are at the point now where Lando is leading us, and he is more demanding of us and the table has turned,\" Joseph added. \"At the beginning we pushed him and now he pushes us, we go away and we work harder.\"\nAs for one of the flashpoints of a gripping season finale, Norris admitted after the race that Joseph did not tell him he was under investigation for going off track and gaining an advantage when fighting Yuki Tsunoda – a sensible move not to distract Norris at a crucial part of the race, especially since the stewards opted to take no further action.\n“I’m good at maths, I did a degree in engineering, said Joseph, when asked about that moment. \"I can set-up a race car, I can work with engineers, that’s bread and butter for me, that’s easy.\n“Psychology is not what an engineer is typically good at, so maintaining that psychology with a driver is the toughest bit of a race engineer’s job.\n“So that’s what I found toughest. But that’s what we worked on, we have a very close relationship, it is very trusting. There are a lot of unspoken things, because there is the trust and it works, it really works.\""}

Carlos Sainz took 13th for Williams, with Tsunoda a penalised 14th after earning a five-second time penalty for his mid-race defence against Norris on an offset tyre strategy.\nNext up was Kimi Antonelli in his Mercedes, from Williams’ Alex Albon, who took a penalty for speeding in the pit lane, and the Racing Bulls cars of Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson – the former losing out with an early stop and the latter penalised for a clash with Bearman.\nAlpine brought up their usual 2025 positions at the rear of the field, with Pierre Gasly ending the day a couple of seconds up on Franco Colapinto, despite also being penalised for exceeding track limits.\nAS IT HAPPENED\nAfter 23 action-packed rounds and a host of twists and turns, it all came down to this: three drivers in contention for the 2025 Drivers’ Championship, with 58 more laps deciding whether it would go to Norris, Verstappen or Piastri.\nWhile Norris headed into the weekend with the points advantage, sitting 12 clear of Verstappen and a further four ahead of Piastri, it was the Red Bull man who seized the initiative in Qualifying to claim pole position over the McLaren pair.\nIt set up a tantalising prospect for race day, with the nerves, excitement and anticipation building throughout the afternoon before the sun set over the Yas Marina Circuit, the floodlights switched on, and the all-important start approached.\nWhen the cars lined up on the grid, with a one-stop strategy expected, it was revealed that the majority of drivers would be starting on the medium tyres, with Piastri, Tsunoda, Antonelli and Stroll going for hards, and Hamilton, Albon and Hulkenberg taking softs.\nA few anxious moments later, it was time for lights out – Verstappen making a strong enough getaway to keep his pole advantage from Norris and Piastri, with Leclerc and Alonso squabbling in fourth and fifth, and Russell dropping to sixth.\nHalfway around the lap, Piastri pulled off one of the moves of the season – and no doubt raised heart rates on the McLaren pit wall – with an audacious move on team mate Norris around the outside of Turn 9, despite him running that harder rubber.\nNorris still held the position and points he needed to secure the crown, but with Leclerc and Alonso hovering in his mirrors. On Lap 4, Leclerc piled the pressure on with his own DRS-assisted look into Turn 9, but he could not quite make it stick.\nRussell reported a long brake pedal after his tricky start, which included a heap of wheelspin, but that did not stop him from reclaiming fifth by passing Alonso into the Turn 6/7 chicane. Behind them, Bortoleto held seventh over Hadjar and Ocon, with Tsunoda rounding out the top 10.\nElsewhere, Colapinto was noted for a start procedure infringement, as well as Hamilton and Albon and Antonelli and Stroll for midfield battles – the latter two regarding drivers leaving the track and gaining an advantage.\n“This is good for now Max. We may wish to go longer, so just keep on top,” was the message to race leader Verstappen at this point. Shortly afterwards, Hulkenberg became the first driver to pit, swapping his softs for a set of hards.\nWith the race reaching double lap figures, Piastri received a hurry-up from his engineer to go and chase Verstappen, and in turn give Norris a little more clean air to work with. Norris was informed of that message and continued to hover precariously around the one-second DRS window back to Leclerc.\nAnother incident involving Gasly and Hulkenberg was noted and dismissed at this point, while Lawson and Bearman came under the stewards’ microscope for alleged erratic driving – the New Zealander subsequently being given a five-second penalty.\nRussell, Hadjar and Bearman were the next drivers to pit, swapping their medium tyres for hards. Would Ferrari and McLaren respond by pitting Leclerc and Norris? McLaren’s mechanics initially came out into the pit lane, but then returned to the garage.\n“Keep building this gap on Leclerc, it gives us choices,” was the next message to Norris. Then, at the end of Lap 16, the Briton headed for the pits along with Leclerc and Alonso. Crucially, Norris rejoined ahead of Russell, but with a lot of midfield runners to clear.\nVerstappen and Piastri (understandably given his more durable tyres) stayed out for the time being, with just under two seconds between the pair. “Oscar, do you think we could do Plan A?” Piastri’s engineer enquired. “I think it’s doable for now,” came the reply.\nWhile the top two pressed ahead, Norris had his hands full behind yet-to-pit cars, forcing decisive moves on Antonelli, Stroll and Lawson to regain clear air. A little bit further back, Leclerc was noted for moving under braking in a battle with Russell, before both looked to replicate Norris’ charge through the traffic.\nNext up for Norris? Outgoing Red Bull man Tsunoda. “We expect Norris to be in your DRS within one lap. All you can when he catches,” the Japanese racer was told over the radio. “I know what to do, so leave to me,” he hit back.\nOn Lap 23, Norris got within that DRS window – Tsunoda almost forcing the championship contender onto the grass as they charged towards the Turn 6/7 chicane, but Norris keeping his cool under braking to make the move stick and edge one step closer to the crown.\nHowever, a couple of messages soon followed from the stewards and added some more jeopardy to the situation. One being for Tsunoda allegedly forcing Norris off the track, and one being for Norris allegedly leaving the track and gaining an advantage.\nA lap later, leader Verstappen decided it was the right time to pit and swap his medium tyres for hards, releasing Piastri into the lead. Norris, meanwhile, got his head down to pump in a series of fastest laps and create a two-second buffer over Leclerc.\nThe wait for the stewards’ decisions was a short one, with Tsunoda being given a five-second penalty due to his weaving, and no further action being taken on Norris’ overtake, serving as a huge boost for the latter’s title aspirations.\n“Penalty?! What penalty, bro?!” Tsunoda shouted over the radio when informed of his penalty. At the same time, the stewards confirmed that there would be no further action over Leclerc and Russell’s earlier scrap at Turn 9.\nAfter 33 laps, the yet-to-stop Piastri led Verstappen by some 11 seconds, with Norris five seconds further back in third, from Leclerc, Russell, Stroll (also yet to pit), Alonso, Bortoleto, Ocon and Hulkenberg, who had Bearman all over his tail in the fight for the final point.\nWilliams were having a quiet race, with Sainz and Albon running 12th and 13th, ahead of early-stopper Hadjar, the Alpines of Gasly and Colapinto, Hamilton (who had moved to a two-stop strategy), the penalised Tsunoda, Lawson and Antonelli.\n“The rear’s starting to get a bit worse now,” reported leader Piastri over the radio as the laps ticked by – the gap back to Verstappen coming down to six seconds, with Norris and Leclerc also closing in rapidly.\nOn Lap 40, with Piastri still circulating up front, Leclerc headed to the pit lane for a second time to take on fresh medium tyres, prompting Norris to cover that off next time around (fitting hards). At the back, Albon was given a five-second penalty for speeding on his own visit to the pits.\nNot long after that, Verstappen got himself into Piastri’s DRS window and breezed past the McLaren down the back straight. A few corners later, Piastri made his long-awaited pit stop and moved over to the medium tyres for the final few laps.\nPiastri was told to hunt down Verstappen – now 24 seconds clear – on his fresh rubber, but while he would cut that number in half over the remaining laps, the top two positions were essentially locked in, and all the attention turned back to Norris.\nAfter that early pressure from Leclerc, Norris had managed to build a more comfortable margin, with more than five seconds now separating the two drivers, meaning all the champion-elect had to do was keep things under control until the finish.\nKeep it under control is exactly what he did and, just over 15 seconds after Verstappen took a deserved final win of the season, Norris secured the third position he required to earn the title and write his name into the F1 history books.\nLeclerc took the best of the rest accolade in fourth, from Russell and Alonso, as Ocon pipped Hamilton to seventh after a fierce late-race battle, Hulkenberg came home ninth and the late-stopping Stroll bagged the final point – even with a penalty for erratic driving against Sainz.\nBortoleto just missed out on a point in 11th, with Bearman dropping from ninth to 12th after a penalty for making more than one change of direction in a late fight with Stroll, Sainz winding up 13th and Tsunoda – after his own penalty – having to settle for 14th.\nAlbon joined Norris, Leclerc, Hamilton and Hulkenberg in making two stops, but could only place 16th, behind Antonelli, with the Racing Bulls featuring down in 17th and 18th after difficult races for 2026 Red Bull driver Hadjar and Lawson.\nA five-second penalty for exceeding track limits on multiple occasions did little to impact Gasly’s evening, as the Frenchman placed a lapped 19th over team mate Colapinto at the end of a season Alpine will be keen to move on from.\nAs the drivers returned to the pits for one last time in 2025, one man stood above the rest – Norris completing a series of donuts on the main straight before climbing atop his McLaren, taking in the cheers from the crowd and starting to process what he had just achieved.\nKey quote\n“Oh God! I’ve not cried in a while,” said Norris. “I didn’t think I’d cry but I did. It’s a long journey. First of all, I want to say a big thanks to my guys, everyone at McLaren, my parents... I’m not crying! My mum, my dad, they were the ones who supported me since the beginning.\n“It feels amazing. Now I know what Max feels like a little bit, and I want to congratulate Max and Oscar, my two biggest competitors all season. It’s been a pleasure to race against both of them, and I’ve learnt a lot from both of them as well. I’ve enjoyed it, it’s been a long year, but we did it, and I’m so proud of everyone.”\nWhat’s next\nF1 drivers and teams will now take a break over the winter before returning to action ahead of the 2026 season in a private test at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya from January 26-30 ."}

Nevertheless, he maintained his rediscovered form to qualify third for the finale, behind his fellow title contenders on the front row.\nWith a 16-point deficit to overcome in order to win the championship, he recognised that a lot had to fall into place for him to have a chance. A strong start saw him pass Norris for P2 on the opening lap, but he couldn’t do much to get the better of Verstappen , especially on a 41-lap stint on hard tyres.\nAsked how he was feeling about finishing second in the race, he replied: “Honestly, pretty good. I knew that going into today I needed the stars to align to win the championship.\n“Ultimately, I tried my best and put myself in the best position I could to try and win the race and give myself the best opportunity, but it wasn’t to be. I think we can be very proud of the season we’ve had.\n“On a personal level, it’s obviously not quite the ending that I wished for but I think when you look at the season as a whole, I’m very proud of the work that I’ve been able to put in and my team have been able to put in to make so much progress from last year. I’m looking forward to plenty more fights in the future.”\nMcLaren elected to split the strategies between their drivers, starting the eventual champion on medium tyres while Piastri was given a set of the hard compound to begin the race. The choice allowed him to extend his first stint, but meant that by the time he finally pitted, he faced Verstappen’s unassailable lead of 24 seconds.\nDue to the three contenders all finishing on the podium, Piastri lost out on his maiden title by 13 points, with Norris ending the season on 423 to beat their Red Bull rival by just two points.\n“It is nice to end the last couple of weekends on a relative high, certainly from a performance point of view,” he summarised. “I guess individually it was nice to find some form again because it would have been pretty painful to end it on the note that Austin, Mexico and Brazil kind of went to.\n“Ultimately, there were ups and downs through the year. I’ll look back on the ups with a lot of pride and joy, and look on the downs with plenty of lessons learned. There are plenty more years left to go and hopefully plenty more opportunities.”"}

The Briton needed a podium finish to secure the title – and he ultimately did the job required in order to become the 2025 World Champion, resisting pressure from the likes of Leclerc to hold onto that vital top-three result.\nOn the other side of the McLaren garage, Oscar Piastri ’s title chances were slimmer – but that did not stop the Australian from putting in a determined drive at the Yas Marina Circuit, storming past Norris on Lap 1 to take second place. While he did not have the pace to chase down Verstappen, Piastri’s good weekend ends his season on a better note following a difficult run during the second half of the championship.\nEsteban Ocon completed his first season as a Haas driver with one of his strongest drives from recent races. The Frenchman kept himself in the battle for points throughout, and even held off the chasing Ferrari of Lewis Hamilton towards the end of the Grand Prix to claim seventh place.\nQualifying had not gone well for Nico Hulkenberg , with the Kick Sauber man finding himself down in P18. However, from there he managed to make his way through the field during Sunday’s race, leaving the German “very, very pleased” to score two points with a final result of ninth.\nDespite being the closest challenger to the title contenders in Qualifying – where he took fourth on the grid – Russell faced a tougher outing in the Grand Prix, losing out at the start to Leclerc and Alonso. While the Mercedes was struggling for pace, Russell managed to bring it home in a somewhat lonely P5.\nIn the team’s last weekend under the Sauber name before transitioning to Audi in 2026, Gabriel Bortoleto only just missed out on making it a double-points finish for the squad in Abu Dhabi. The Brazilian initially ran in the top 10, but lost out during the pit stops and had to settle for 11th in the final race of his rookie campaign.\nThere was disappointment for Ollie Bearman at the end of the season finale, with the Briton handed a five-second time penalty for changing direction more than once whilst defending against Lance Stroll, putting him in a final result of P12. However, it was an otherwise solid outing for the Haas driver, marking a continued strong run of form across the second half of the season.\nMissing out\nHamilton just misses out on a place in the top half of this week's Power Rankings, the seven-time World Champion having fought his way to a P8 result after starting the race back in P16."}

Preparing for his final lap of the session, he asked his race engineer to let him out behind Verstappen as he would “probably give me a tow” in order to stop a McLaren driver from taking a front row spot.\nThe tactic didn’t quite work out, and he was further hindered by the rear of his car feeling unstable in Q3 – onboards showed him fighting to stay on the track and avoid the barriers, contributing to his eventual P4 finish.\n“Obviously we were near the top of the leaderboard in Q1 and at the top in Q2, but those three around me were on the old tyres and they were matching my lap times,” he later said. “We knew they were going to be a step ahead, and I knew that I had to do something special just to even be in the fight.\n“I wasn’t very happy with Q3 but honestly, anything higher than P4 was not really a possibility today so we’ll take it.\n“I don’t think that we’re in the fight with those three again, but I can’t imagine Max is just going to sit there and let them all drive off into the sunset and finish 1-2-3. There could be opportunities – we’ll play it by ear.\n“For sure, the team are going to be up all night making plans, but I’m pretty confident those plans are going to be pretty different by Lap 1, Lap 2, every single lap of the race. It’ll be an interesting one.”\nHis team mate Kimi Antonelli similarly dropped down in the order as Qualifying went on, going from third in Q1 to 14th in Q2 after putting an eventful FP3 behind him. In the pit lane, the Italian was released straight into Yuki Tsunoda's path and the two collided, damaging both cars.\nThe change in performance throughout Qualifying left Antonelli searching for answers as he explained: “It’s obviously very frustrating. I struggled a lot with the rear in Q2 and it was just difficult. In Q1 I went much quicker than Q2. I’m just really struggling to understand what happened there.\n“I think it’s not going to be an easy race tomorrow. Degradation is going to be big. I just need to maximise the result and try to do the best race possible.”"}

Sainz finished third in Baku and in Qatar for his two podiums in his debut season for the Grove-based team, but his year ended with a P13 in Abu Dhabi.\n“We were starting 12th and we were the 12th fastest car and with nothing exciting happening in the race we were always going to finish there - with [Lewis] Hamilton making it through the pack to [drop us to] P13,” Sainz explained.\n“Everyone else, we just did everything we could to finish in the points but there was simply not enough pace this weekend, which I hope it serves as a good wake-up call to the team, that after a podium you come back in Abu Dhabi thinking you are going to be strong and we were quite weak this weekend.\n“I’m actually happy this happened, so we go into the winter without falling asleep.”\nAfter losing his 2025 Ferrari seat to Hamilton, Sainz had options on the F1 grid to choose from with Williams boss James Vowles successfully persuading him to pick the Grove-based squad as they plot their way back towards the front of the grid.\nWith their P5 finish this season showing that they are heading in the right direction, Sainz reflected on his first Williams campaign, acknowledging there were plenty of tough times early on.\n“For sure, it has been a very challenging first half to the season,\" he said.\n\"But I hope all that frustration that I got from that first half, as I said, even if we were quick, even if the adaptation was good, if all that frustration meant that then two podiums were meant to come and one podium in the Sprint, I definitely welcome that frustration and that lack of points in the first half.\n“I think in the second half [of the season] I proved to everyone why we made this switch, and what we are trying to achieve here and why I think we are a force to be reckoned with for the future.\n“If you had told me last year we would have scored those podiums and be P5 in the Constructors’ like we are, I would have taken it. And overall, we have to take it as a very positive first year with Williams.”"}

So I think there will be some prudency, which is I think what I would recommend, certainly to Lando!\n“He's in a very strong position from this point of view, so I think that's the approach. In terms of the options that Max has available to try and play his cards, honestly I'm not too worried. I think we will see some interesting racing, but I'm sure all this will happen within the boundaries of sportsmanship and fairness.”\nOne option posited to Stella was that Verstappen may attempt to back Norris and Piastri into the clutches of the chasing pack behind – similar to Lewis Hamilton’s attempts to back up then-Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg at the 2016 season finale at the same track.\nBut Stella said he felt that McLaren had the advantage in having both Norris and Piastri up in the top three – with Red Bull’s Yuki Tsunoda having effectively sacrificed his Qualifying to aid Verstappen by giving him a tow, with the Japanese driver set to start P10 in what could be his final F1 race after losing his seat at Red Bull for 2026.\n“I think it's an advantage,” said Stella of the starting position of McLaren’s drivers relative to the Red Bulls. “We have more options to play. At some stage, if you slow down too much, you may be susceptible to being attacked with undercuts.\n“You may expose yourself in terms of being overtaken. So I think definitely it's good that we are there with two cars. That's the position I would take, rather than having the two cars split and separated on track.”\nAsked, meanwhile, about the parallels between 2025 and 2010 – when Stella was the race engineer at Ferrari for Fernando Alonso when the Spaniard lost out at the Abu Dhabi season finale to the Red Bull of Sebastian Vettel, Stella said: “I think the parallel this year fits even better than last year.\n“Last year, we were playing for the Constructors’ Championship, the Drivers’ Championship was already closed as a matter. [In 2025] we go with three drivers into the final race, it's Abu Dhabi.\n“You always want to make sure that you enter these events remembering that it's a privilege to be part of this page of history, of Formula 1, which will be the case independently of the outcome.”"}

And as I said to Mark Webber’s partner Ann Neal, back in the Multi-21 days when she suggested that he “couldn’t do” some of the things he was doing, you had to know Helmut and his background first before you could truly understand him.\nIf you believed everything you heard about him, you'd think he was a tyrant, a bully who had no qualms about smashing young drivers’ careers without a second thought if they failed to get the job done. But he was raised in the school of hard knocks, where you stood for yourself.\nHe and Jochen Rindt , who would become the sport’s only posthumous World Champion in 1970, were good buddies. Each had that wanton wildness during their school days that would prove sound preparation for the racing world that awaited them, but accelerated their expulsion from the Pestalozzi School in Graz.\n“Let’s put it this way,” Helmut once explained of his removal from the school with a chuckle. “If we left, they would give us a positive report. If not, we wouldn’t make it. So it was a very attractive offer. We messed about, we skipped lessons. We were a wild age and we really didn’t fit in this system of nice boys.\n“So then we went to a boarding school called Bad Aussee, in the mountains, and that was a really wild time because whatever you had to do, you had to organise yourself. Climbing out of the windows during the night…”\nFirst they raced each other on their ‘wombats’ (mopeds), later in cars, on the roads around Graz. The deal was that each would drive whichever car was available, until they made a mistake, whereupon they would be replaced. If there was more than one car, the deal was that if you stuffed it, you were on your own. Helmut once spun his father’s Chevrolet, ‘borrowed’ without paternal permission, down a hill. Get out of that! Thus, the young electrical dealer’s son was used to fending for himself.\nIt's largely overlooked now, but he was a damn good driver himself, and after Jochen’s death at Monza in September 1970 he focused on his own career. He was a topline European 2-litre sportscar racer in a Lola T212, as Brian Redman will attest, and won Le Mans in 1971 in a Martini Porsche 917K with co-driver Gijs van Lennep.\nHe got his first chance in F1 with BRM in 1971. The team was a shambles as Louis Stanley sought to run five cars, and it wasn’t until 1972, and the French GP at Clermont Ferrand, that Helmut finally got a halfway decent P160B instead of an old nail P153.\nHe qualified it sixth on this mini-Nurburgring, and was dicing for fourth with Ronnie Peterson in a March 721G and champion-elect Emerson Fittipaldi in a Lotus 72, the leading BRM driver by a country mile. The track was littered with stones, and one was thrown up from one of their wheels, went through his visor like a bullet, and struck him straight in the eye.\nHe was the man who could have been Niki Lauda before Niki Lauda. But in that moment his racing career ended.\n“It was all coming together,” he remembered. “And funnily enough I had just got some autographs to sign and there were photos of me in my 153 and one in the 160. In the 153 I was sitting properly, in the 160 I remember that it came late – like it always did with BRM! – and I was sitting about 10cm higher. They couldn’t adjust the seat properly for the race. If I would have been in my normal seating position, nothing would have happened.\n“I didn’t know immediately that I was in trouble. I saw something coming. I just remembered I was sixth and we had 258 litres of fuel and there were 18 cars behind me, so if I don’t do something smart, they could hit me. I managed to raise my arm and park the car, fortunately for me and the others.\n“I was for two months in hospital and I had stitches in my injured eye and I couldn’t see because I had covers on both eyes. Then you are thinking a lot. At one stage I said, ‘That’s it!’ I was 29, the victim of an accident… One night it was clear that it wouldn’t be the same as it was before… But life goes forward, and I had to cope with that.\n“Of course I was bitter in the beginning. It was, ‘Oh, by Christ,’ but being in the hospital you see or you hear what is going on around you, so then you relatively see that it is not so serious. You have to get normal again, and stay grounded.”\nYears later, I was speaking to him about his protégé Helmuth Koinigg, who would lose his life in the 1974 US GP. Helmut said Koinigg’s Formula Vee sponsor wanted the pair of them to do a hillclimb. Helmut told Little Helmuth he would only do it if he could have a specific car, the one that his protégé wanted – because it was quicker. Of course, Big Helmut prevailed and duly won. And then he told me the most extraordinary story.\nHeading home he read in a newspaper of the crash of scheduled Alitalia flight 112 when the airline’s Douglas DC-8-43, flying from the Leonardo da Vinci Airport in Rome to Palermo International Airport, flew into Sicily’s Mount Longa. In Italy’s biggest single aircraft disaster, all 108 passengers and seven crew were killed.\n“If I hadn’t done that hillclimb I would have been on that flight, heading out to test for Alfa Romeo for the Targa Florio,” he said nonchalantly as we sat outside one of the attractive little hospitality units in the paddock in China.\n“Man, I’ve never seen that written anywhere!” I exclaimed.\n“That’s because I never told anyone,” Helmut said, as if it was no big deal.\nImagine… That had occurred on May 5. He would have been entitled to feel that the gods were smiling upon him. Then, in a flash on July 2, that stone took his eye and his career was over… Such cruel fortune…\nHe took up running his own hotel, and then ventured back into racing by setting up his own Formula 3000 team. Along the way he worked with another doomed young Austrian, Markus Hottinger, who was killed in a Formula 2 race at Hockenheim in 1980.\n“There was this thing with the Austrians, that they had such odd accidents,” he recalled quietly. “With Jochen it was under braking and the nose wedged beneath the guardrail at Monza and it was torn off and he was pulled out of the car. Two metres earlier or later...\n\"Fortunately I was not at Watkins Glen when Helmuth was killed. That was a big shock. He had a puncture and went under the guardrail, and was decapitated. And with Hottinger, a wheel from Derek Warwick’s car was bouncing around and it hit his head…\n“Both Helmuth and Markus gave something to racing… And, yes, both of them could have made it.” He paused for a moment in his reflection, then said, as he had with his own incident, “But life goes on…”\nSo that all goes a long way to explaining why he has left the racing battlefield strewn with the careers of the myriad drivers who failed to go all the way through Red Bull ’s youth programme: Tonio Liuzzi; Patrick Friesacher; Sebastian Bourdais; Scott Speed; Sebastien Buemi; Jaime Alguersuari; Lewis Williamson; Christian Klien; Pierre Gasly ; Alex Albon ; Sergio Perez; Liam Lawson ; Yuki Tsunoda .\nWith his famed, Lauda-matching Austrian pragmatism, he has always sought the best, looked for those drivers prepared to go the extra mile to succeed. He’s never been one to wrap an avuncular arm around a struggling racer. And he found what he was looking for with Sebastian Vettel and, later Max Verstappen .\nHe admits cheerfully that back in the dark days after his career ended in 1972, he never dreamed he would get a second chance in Formula 1. “No, not at all. But the chance came fortunately through Red Bull with the Jaguar team.”\nHe and the great Dietrich Mateschitz knew one another in Styria long before their collaboration at Red Bull began. “I was the one who said Christian [Horner] is our man, and I’m glad I did,” he said a few years ago, before the death of Mateschitz and Horner's departure from the team earlier this year.\n“In the beginning, a lot of experts said it couldn’t work, but he’s proved that he’s capable. I saw how he was running his F3000 team; we were young and we were different, and we made the old-established people see differently. It made sense. Here, it’s very open, and we don’t tell stories. We just try to find the best solution for the team, and we do it without any egos.\n“I don’t handle the daily operations. That rests with Christian. If it’s a major decision, either I decide or else if necessary I take it to Didi [Mateschitz].”\nChristian didn’t always agree with Helmut’s version of how they worked together, but the fact is that the old warrior played a key role in forming the team, and together they would take it to such fantastic success.\nAs of today, Red Bull Racing have won 130 Grands Prix, eight Drivers’ and six Constructors’ World Championships, toppling the likes of Ferrari and Mercedes along the way.\nSadly, it now looks like it is time for him to saddle up. Times change, but it makes me sad. No matter what you thought about the way he operated, Helmut Marko was a true racer on and off the track, with the scars to prove it, a great sense of humour and a refreshing penchant for saying exactly what he thought. He leaves a significant, often overlooked legacy, and I for one will miss his huge presence in the paddock."}

But that position does not tell the full story of what happened in a thrilling season finale.\nStarting from P10, Tsunoda was put on the hard compound tyre with one aim – to wind up ahead of Championship leader Lando Norris and do his best to disrupt the McLaren man and cost him track time, all in a bid to aid Max Verstappen’s Championship challenge.\nTsunoda’s game plan worked to the extent that he found Norris behind him midway through the race. But he was unable to keep the freshly-shod McLaren at bay, and in battling hard with Norris, Tsunoda was handed a penalty by the stewards to boot.\nHe received a five-second time penalty to serve at his own pit stop for “more than one change of direction to defend position” and his defence had even involved pushing Norris as wide as possible when the McLaren drew up alongside, Norris winding up with all four wheels off the track as a result.\n“Car 4 was making an overtaking move on Car 22,” read the document from the FIA explaining Tsunoda's penalty. \"Car 22 made a number of changes of direction which ultimately resulted in Car 4 having to go off track to avoid a collision. In doing so, Car 22 also effectively forced Car 4 off the track.\"\n“I really tried my absolute best to score points today, and I think there could have been potential to do so, but the penalty made it tricky,” explained Tsunoda after the race. “We opted for a different strategy, and we were running well until the battle with Lando. I tried to hold him up, but he was pretty fast, and then I ended up with a frustrating penalty.”\nTsunoda now bows out of a fulltime F1 seat as he sees his cockpit at Red Bull filled by Isack Hadjar for next season, instead becoming the team’s reserve driver. But he was quick to thank his mechanics for all their hard work on his car this year – including through various set-up changes.\n“I enjoyed a lot with the mechanics especially, the amount of support I had from them was phenomenal,\" Tsunoda added. \"Probably some phases they were hating me because of a lot of overnight changes, a lot of you know massive set-up changes between FP3 and Qualifying.\n\"I told them yesterday, at least I trained them well, they are very sharp. Yeah, I’m sure they appreciated me.\"\n“This year, if I look back at just the word called luck – I don’t want to say or use the word called luck to be honest. But I felt deeply unlucky… Every race weekend, something went on. This weekend, had to revert back to the old floor without my control you know with that incident in the pit lane [with Antonelli].\n“Never had a straightforward race but at least I gave it all, I think I’ve shown what I can do.”\nTsunoda was on the F1 grid for five straight seasons, joining what was then AlphaTauri in 2021 and racing for the team all the way to the start of this season, when he was promoted to Red Bull after two races in place of Liam Lawson . And while he was disappointed to lose his seat, Tsunoda has at least learned plenty from driving and working alongside Verstappen this season.\n”He is the best driver on the grid, seeing him work and extract everything that he does is, just shows how good he is, and he has the mentality to go with it, it's very inspiring to see,” concluded Tsunoda."}

Piastri, meanwhile, took third place as the top three prepare to battle for the World Championship on Sunday.\nRussell ended the session in fourth for Mercedes, while Charles Leclerc claimed fifth and Fernando Alonso took a solid sixth in the Aston Martin. Gabriel Bortoleto put in a good drive for Kick Sauber in seventh, with Haas’ Esteban Ocon, the Racing Bulls of Isack Hadjar and Yuki Tsunoda – in his final Qualifying for Red Bull – completing the top 10.\nQualifying results\nFORMULA 1 ETIHAD AIRWAYS ABU DHABI GRAND PRIX 2025\nDespite strong pace through the weekend so far, Haas’ Ollie Bearman missed the cut for Q2 – as did Carlos Sainz, the Williams man ending up in P12 one week on from his podium in Qatar.\nLiam Lawson followed in 13th for Racing Bulls, while Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli departed Q2 in 14th place – the Italian having reported struggles with the rear of his car – ahead of the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll in 15th.\nThe big story from Q1 was another early exit for Lewis Hamilton, the Ferrari driver finding himself down in P16 just hours after a crash into the barriers during third practice. There was also disappointment for Williams’ Alex Albon, who will line up one spot behind in P17.\nA good showing for Nico Hulkenberg on Friday did not follow through come Qualifying, with the Kick Sauber man winding up in 18th, while the Alpine pair of Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto brought up the rear in 19th and 20th respectively.\nAS IT HAPPENED\nQ1 – Piastri quickest as Hamilton exits\nAfter an eventful practice session earlier in the day – topped by the Mercedes of Russell – the attentions of the paddock switched to the final Qualifying of the year, a crucial session in that it would set the starting order for the title-deciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.\nAs Q1 got underway under the floodlights at 1800 local time, Hamilton was amongst the first on track with the medium tyres bolted on, the Ferrari driver seemingly doing a shake down of his car following his crash out of Free Practice 3 a few hours prior.\nWith others joining the action a few minutes in – the majority running the soft compound, the exception being Hamilton’s team mate Leclerc on the mediums – it was Russell who had gone fastest following the opening runs via an effort of 1m 23.247s.\nThe margins were incredibly fine, however, with Bearman only 0.007s behind in second while Piastri was a further one thousandth of a second adrift of the Haas. Verstappen placed in fourth, ahead of Hamilton, Alonso and championship leader Norris.\nAt the other end of the timesheets, Ocon, Albon, Leclerc, Gasly and Colapinto – the latter yet to get a lap on the board after having both of his times deleted for exceeding track limits – were the names at risk in the elimination zone. Gasly and Stroll had also fallen victim to track limits, with each also seeing one of their laps erased.\nFollowing a brief lull, the pack prepared to return to the track for their last runs as the session entered its final minutes. Title contenders Norris, Verstappen and Piastri were all sporting fresh soft tyres – and this seemed to pay off for the latter, who went quickest on a 1m 22.605s.\nThis put the Australian two-tenths clear of Verstappen, while Norris was just over half a second away in sixth place, with Antonelli, Alonso and Leclerc ahead of him. Meanwhile others were trying to guarantee their spot in Q2, with Gasly improving before being pushed back down the order by Stroll.\nAlso finding themselves in the danger zone were Albon, Hulkenberg and Colapinto – and while Hamilton initially looked to have avoided the bottom five, improvements from others saw the Briton end up in 16th place, resulting in another Q1 exit.\nKnocked out: Hamilton, Albon, Hulkenberg, Gasly, Colapinto\nQ2 – Russell sets the pace, Antonelli drops out\nAs the dust settled on Q1, 15 minutes went on the clock to kickstart Q2 at the Yas Marina Circuit. Verstappen was the first to head out, the Dutchman enjoying a quiet track as he set a banker lap on used soft tyres.\nOthers soon started to join the fray – and when everybody had set a time, Russell was again the man on top thanks to his lap of 1m 22.730s, giving him an advantage of 0.022s over second-placed Verstappen, while Norris was only 0.074s behind Russell in third.\nPiastri and Alonso followed in fourth and fifth respectively, but those less at ease in the danger zone were Hadjar, Tsunoda, Antonelli, Bearman and Lawson. A queue had formed in the pit lane as the field readied themselves for their final runs – yet Verstappen was not amongst them, Red Bull seemingly feeling safe enough to stay in the garage.\nWhile Bortoleto surged up to an eye-catching fourth, fellow rookie Antonelli could not do enough to avoid elimination, the Mercedes driver being pushed down to P14. Hadjar climbed up into the top 10, which then knocked out team mate Lawson.\nThere were also contrasting fortunes at Haas, with Ocon moving into ninth just as Bearman missed the cut in 11th. Tsunoda made it through in 10th, but it was not such a good day for Sainz and Stroll, both exiting in 12th and 15th respectively.\nKnocked out: Bearman, Sainz, Lawson, Antonelli, Stroll\nQ3 – Verstappen outpaces Norris and Piastri for pole\nTsunoda was the first to emerge as the top-10 shootout began, but it was the other Red Bull of Verstappen that topped the timesheets once the first runs had been completed, the World Champion going quickest on an impressive 1m 22.295s.\nIn his final weekend racing for the squad, Tsunoda played a team role by giving Verstappen a tow, with the Dutchman subsequently beating closest challenger Piastri by 0.327s. Norris was four-and-a-half tenths back in third, followed by Leclerc and Russell.\nAhead of the decisive closing runs, Russell asked his team if they could get him behind Verstappen to get a tow of his own. McLaren, meanwhile, would be looking for a way to beat the four-time World Champion.\nAs the all-important last Qualifying laps of 2025 came in, Verstappen went even quicker on a 1m 22.207s. Piastri closed the gap down, but at 0.230s adrift it was not enough to beat the Dutch driver – and while Norris could not clinch pole either, the Briton outpaced his team mate to slot into second, 0.201 adrift of Verstappen.\nThis put Piastri in third, with Russell the nearest to the title contenders in fourth. Leclerc ended a tough recent run for Ferrari with P5, while a slightly mixed-up top 10 was rounded out by Alonso, Bortoleto, Ocon, Hadjar and Tsunoda.\nKey quote\n\"In Q2 I stayed on scrubbed tyres, and I think those laps already felt quite decent,\" said Verstappen. \"Of course then in Q3, around here track temp is coming down, you know that you can push a bit more, and that’s exactly what we did. We found a bit more lap time and of course I’m incredibly happy to be in first. That’s the only thing that we can do, right? That’s the only thing that we can control. I try to just maximise everything we have, what we have with the car, and we definitely did that in Qualifying.\"\nWhat's next\nThe 2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is set to begin at 1700 local time on Sunday.

That’s the only thing that we can control.\n“I try to just maximise everything we have, what we have with the car, and we definitely did that in Qualifying.”\nPushed on the challenge of setting the car up in Abu Dhabi, given the warmer, unrepresentative FP1 and FP3 sessions, he added: “You have to of course try and guess a little bit how much the track is going to improve, and of course it cools down a lot.\n“You’re never like 100% sure if it’s going to work, but I do think that what we changed definitely helped me a little bit more to feel better in Qualifying.”\nNow Verstappen and the rest of the field’s focus switches to Sunday’s race, where the reigning four-time World Champion will be looking to overturn Norris’ 12-point advantage – the Briton knowing a podium is enough to secure the title.\nAsked if it will be all eyes forward, rather than worrying about what the McLarens are doing, Verstappen said: “We’ll find out tomorrow! Let’s see what we can do.\n“Of course, I will try to win the race, but also in the back of my mind we want to try and score a lot of points to still try and win that championship. We need a bit of luck on what is happening behind us.”\nVerstappen also offered a few words of gratitude to outgoing team mate Yuki Tsunoda, who made it through to Q3 and gave the Dutchman a tow en route to his own Qualifying position of 10th."}

We could have also very easily given up at that point, when you’re that far behind.\n“I don’t think that’s how this team works. We always try to look for improvements and understand our issues, and that’s definitely what we did. The turnaround has been fun, and today has been fun.\n“We didn’t win the championship, okay, that happens, that’s life, and it’s not something that I’ll be too sad about.

He made it through Q1 and Q2 using just the two sets of tyres to have two new sets of softs for Q3. On his first lap he received a tow from his team mate, Tsunoda making Q3 for the second straight weekend. That launched him well ahead of his rivals – but it proved unnecessary, as he went even faster on his second run, even though he did not get the same tow. He starts on pole, but still has it all to do tomorrow with Norris breathing down his neck from P2. As for Tsunoda, his Q3 was sacrificed to help his team mate, at the end of a difficult day that included an FP3 crash in the pit lane when Antonelli was released into his path. That damaged his floor, meaning he is on an older spec part for the rest of the weekend now.\nMax Verstappen, 1st, 1:22.207\n\"It was a Simply Lovely Qualifying. We did well the whole weekend, have been fine tuning the car and then also made some final changes which helped the car a little bit. This allowed me to push a bit more to the limit and extract the most out of the car. We were improving nicely in Qualifying and then found a little bit more lap time with the corners. The big question mark is can we keep up that pace in the race? Thank you to Yuki for the tow, it helped for sure, but it was nice of him to give up one of his laps. He was a great Team player, so thank you for that. Tomorrow, the plan is to win the race and then we need a bit of luck to win the Championship, it’s as simple as that. We will go all out and have nothing to lose, whether we need to attack or defend. The most important battle needs to happen tomorrow and we need to outscore them by 12 points; we knew that if we wanted to be in the fight we had to be first. I have the least to lose and I am very relaxed. It is exciting to be on Pole, but we just need a bit of luck for the rest of it and some Abu Dhabi magic.\"\nYuki Tsunoda, 10th, No time set in Q3\n“Because of the pit lane incident in FP3, we had to change back to the old floor on my car, which did compromise performance somewhat and was not ideal. I knew it could be difficult to get through to Q3 but I was able to do that. I have been able to help Max and that was always the aim, I am proud of that today. I will try to support Max as much as possible tomorrow, that is my goal and my main focus. It might not be a straightforward strategy but if I can help Max to win a fifth Drivers’ Championship, then that is the priority. The top 10 looks very tight, so let’s see what I can do.\"\nLaurent Mekies, Team Principal\n\"It really was an amazing job from everyone today, from Max, Yuki and the Team. Max could've taken pole on both his runs today he was that quick. We weren't the fastest on track yesterday, but the car has really improved with each session to get into a great condition for Quali this evening. Well done to everyone for having nailed the right window of the car which allowed us to extract everything from it. We managed to get both cars into Q3 which is great and Yuki did an excellent job on the first run with the tow he gave Max. Of course, there are no points on Saturday here, but we've given ourselves an opportunity to give it our all. Our full concentration and focus turns to maximising everything we can from the car tomorrow, because we cannot control what happens behind us. Everyone here and in Milton Keynes has worked hard to be in this position, fighting for titles to the very end, so it is a privileged position to be in. Whatever happens tomorrow, it has been a sensational end to the year for us.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Pole position qualifier Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates in parc ferme during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Bryn Lennon - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\nMcLaren\nPiastri closed the gap to his team mate in FP3, and then started Qualifying very well indeed with a storming lap in Q1. That meant two McLaren cars pushing each other close in the battle for pole. Both made Q3 with ease but having used one more set of tyres than rival Verstappen. That put them half a step behind on the first runs, with it all to do on the second runs in the top-10 shootout. Both nailed their laps, with Norris just 0.029s ahead of his team mate. But neither had an answer for the pace of the Red Bull. Nonetheless, if they finish where they start, Norris will be World Champion .\nLando Norris, 2nd, 1:22.408\n“We did everything we could do today, but just didn't have the pace in the car for Pole. I was happy with my lap, but I'm of course disappointed to not be on Pole for the final weekend of the year. For tomorrow, we'll focus on doing the best we can. As always, I want to win the race, so that's the goal.”\nOscar Piastri, 3rd, 1:22.437\n“I felt like we maximised what we could today. I was happy with my Q3 laps; we just didn't quite have the pace to answer Max. Our long run pace looks okay, so let's see what we can do tomorrow. I'll focus on delivering the best race I can, and we'll see what happens.”\nAndrea Stella, Team Principal\n“The final Qualifying session of the year is symbolic of the close displays we’ve seen from Lando and Oscar throughout the season. Overall, we can be reasonably happy with our performances as the drivers extracted everything from the car in what was an extremely tight session.\n“We’re now in a strong position to fight for the Championship tomorrow. We are aware that we’re not alone with very competitive drivers starting beside us on the first and second row. However, as a team, it is in our hands. We will make sure we maintain this strong position and execute our preparation at the highest level to be in condition to ensure the reward goes to a papaya driver at the Chequered Flag.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Pole position qualifier Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing and Second placed qualifier Lando Norris of Great Britain and McLaren congratulate each other in parc ferme during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Bryn Lennon - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\nMercedes\nRussell certainly looked in the mix from the word go on Saturday, winding up on top of the standings in FP3 to really give the championship rivals something to consider. He made Q3 comfortably and thus had two sets of fresh tyres to work with, but his car suddenly became more of a handful and after fighting it on his first lap, he got all out of shape in the final corner of his second hot lap. He was also tempted to try and get a tow from Verstappen, who would have loved a car in between himself and the papaya ones – but the timing did not work.\nAntonelli was eliminated in Q2, radioing afterwards to say the rear of his car was missing in action when it mattered. That ended a tricky day for the youngster, who suffered front wing damage when he was released in the pits into the path of Tsunoda in FP3, the duo making contact for which the team were later fined for an unsafe release.\nGeorge Russell, 4th, 1:22.645\n\"We were near the top of the timing screens in both Q1 and Q2, but we knew that Verstappen and the two McLarens had more pace to show come Q3. That turned out to be the case, and I think P4 was ultimately us maximising the package we had this evening. Q3 didn’t go too smoothly on our side but I don’t think we were ever in the fight for the front-row.\n\"Tomorrow’s race will be interesting with the three title contenders starting ahead of us. On ultimate pace, I don’t believe that our race is with them but there could be some strategic implications of that battle that open opportunities for us. We will be considering every eventuality that can help us gain positions and ultimately bring home the points we need to secure P2 in the Constructors’ Championship. That is our only focus for tomorrow and, if we can do that, we can end the season on a high.\"\nKimi Antonelli, 14th, 1:23.080\n\"Qualifying started well in Q1. I was happy with the balance of the car and was able to extract a decent lap time out of it. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case in Q2, and we were knocked out in what was a very tight session. That was a shame as I think we had the pace to be starting in the top six for tomorrow’s race.\n\"Despite tonight’s disappointment, we will refocus now for Sunday’s race. We will do our best to get back into the points and secure P2 in the Constructors’ Championship for the team. Every point could be crucial so that is what my full focus is on. It is important for all of us that we achieve that and end the season on a positive note. Hopefully we can do that and I can end my rookie season in F1 on a high.\"\nToto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport\n\"Qualifying didn’t go quite the way we wanted today. P4 is an OK position to start but obviously P14 is less so. The car has been on a bit of a knife’s edge this weekend. At moments we’ve had good performance, but it’s been difficult to extract consistently. We saw that this evening where we topped Q2 but also had one car fail to make it through. The narrow gaps between all cars also meant that any small mistake was punished heavily.\n\"Despite having the three drivers who will be fighting for the title in front of him tomorrow, I am sure George will just be focused on driving his own race. He will be looking to end his season on a high and hopefully he can do that by getting on the podium. That will be the same with Kimi even though it will be a challenge for him to fight back into the major points-scoring positions. Let’s see how it all plays out though, and we will be ready to take advantage of any opportunities that come our way.\"\nAndrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director\n\"The session was a bit of a disappointment considering that we'd shown good pace earlier today and in the opening stages of qualifying. George was the only car to get through Q1 on a single new set of Soft tyres and Kimi's second push lap put him P3. For Kimi though, his session began it to unravel in Q2. We didn't change anything in our approach, but he started to get the odd snap which in turn caused high temperatures and compounded these issues. Unfortunately, he couldn't reproduce his Q1 pace and finished the session in P14.\n\"George was quickest in Q2, once again on a single new set of Soft tyres but then had similar issues with a loss of rear grip in Q3. With the pace of Verstappen in the Red Bull and the two McLarens, P4 wasn’t a bad result. It was slightly frustrating given what we had seen earlier but if we have good race pace tomorrow, we can still score good points with both cars. That is our sole focus as we look to bring home P2 in the Constructors’ Championship.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W16 on track during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Clive Rose/Getty Images)\nFerrari\nIt was a very mixed bag for Ferrari in Abu Dhabi. Leclerc changed his car completely overnight, and seemed much happier in FP3. His car still looked a handful, but he made it to Q3 and qualified a pretty decent P5 – but has no idea what his race pace will be like, having made so many set-up changes. But Hamilton had a very tough day. He spun out and crashed in FP3 , and although the team managed to rebuild his car in time for Qualifying, he made a mistake on his last flying run. That meant a third straight Q1 exit for the Brit – fourth if you include Sprint Qualifying from Qatar.\nCharles Leclerc, 5th, 1:22.730\n\"I’m satisfied with my lap in Q3 and I don’t think there was much more to extract today. I feel that our team has done a really good job in turning things around this weekend. We made some changes on the set-up between FP2 and FP3, and if paid off. I’m looking forward to the race tomorrow, to see if the changes we made will also help us to get ahead in the race. We can’t get our hopes up too high, because the cars ahead are very fast. It’s up to us to maximise our result tomorrow, and I’ll do my best to take action at the start and hope to bring home a last podium for our whole team this season.\"\nLewis Hamilton, 16th, 1:23.394\n\"Clearly it wasn’t the result we were aiming for today. The team did a great job after FP3, in getting the car ready in time for qualifying, but a mistake in the last sector cost us. I know this track well and I’ll be aiming to deliver a more positive result for the team tomorrow.\"\nFred Vasseur, Team Principal\n\"Overall, we are happy with Charles’ result, as we had a very tough time in both Friday sessions and when it came to deciding on today’s set-up we were quite aggressive and it paid off. For sure, if practice had been better then maybe we could have fought for an even better position, but it is what it is. Now, let’s see what happens tomorrow, let’s see what our race pace is like. It’s been difficult for Lewis, because he did not drive in FP1, having given up his seat to Arthur, and then came the crash halfway through FP3 and in this kind of situation where there are only two tenths separating P4 and P18 if you miss so much running, it’s too much to recover from. You can’t produce a performance based just on FP2. Now let's focus on how to do the best possible for our team to get the best result to end the season well.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Charles Leclerc of Monaco driving the (16) Scuderia Ferrari SF-25 on track during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty Images)\nAston Martin\nAlonso admitted to plenty of changes to the car after a disappointing Friday, and whatever he did clearly worked. He was right in the mix at the front in FP3 and the early stages of Qualifying, and made it to Q3 for the third straight race. From there he grabbed the ‘best of the rest’ slot for his team, as Aston Martin begin the slightly unlikely task of trying to chase down Racing Bulls for sixth in the championship. As for Stroll , he exited in Q2 and thus starts a fair few places back.\nFernando Alonso, 6th, 1:22.902\n\"Extremely happy to finish Qualifying in P6. I am surprised by such a strong result on a circuit with so many low-speed corners, but it is clear the setup changes we made overnight worked well. Hopefully we can maintain this pace tomorrow and continue building momentum throughout the weekend. The aim is to secure some valuable points in the final race of the season.\"\nLance Stroll, 15th, 1:23.097\n\"It was a super tight Qualifying today and we were looking good for Q3, but missed it in the end by less than one tenth. I had a bit of a messy Turn 14 and lost time there on my final push lap in Q2 so that's where it got away from us. When it's that tight, a small margin makes a big difference so a good effort today, but would have hoped for a bit more.\"\nMike Krack, Chief Trackside Officer\n\"It was an exceptionally close field today in the Qualifying session. Lance progressed into Q2, delivering a series of clean laps and narrowly missing out on a spot in Q3 by less than a tenth of a second. Fernando, meanwhile, advanced to Q3 and put in a strong performance to secure P6. We hope this puts us in a good position to score points in the final race of the season tomorrow – we will aim to maximise every opportunity.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Fernando Alonso of Spain driving the (14) Aston Martin F1 Team AMR25 Mercedes on track during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images)\nKick Sauber\nKick Sauber impressed on Friday, and continued their strong form on Saturday. But when it came to Q1, Bortoleto was the one to scrape into Q2 while Hulkenberg somewhat surprisingly exited. The Brazilian found a much better turn of speed in Q2 to make it to the top-10 shootout for the first time since Monza. He grabbed seventh on the grid for his joint-best Qualifying of the year, as he looks to finish his rookie season in the points one last time.\nNico Hulkenberg, 18th, 1:23.450\n\"It’s very disappointing, it feels we just tripped over ourselves today, especially as the car’s setup felt very good and there was the potential for a very good result. The run plan and sequence just didn’t work out: we were the last car out there. We waited long in the pitlane, which meant the tyres were a bit too cold, and I hit a lot of traffic both on the out-lap and the timed lap. With the field as tight as it has been at the last few events, those small margins make a big difference, and we let it slip through our fingers. The potential in the car was there earlier in the weekend and even this morning, but we didn’t put it together in Q1 and made our lives very hard for tomorrow. Following and overtaking here are very difficult with this generation of cars, so starting from the back will be a challenge, but we’ll do what we can from there.\"\nGabriel Bortoleto, 7th, 1:22.904\n“It feels great to finish the season with a qualifying like this one. The whole session was incredibly tight: we were just a few thousandths away from being knocked out in Q1, then pulled out a mega lap in Q2 and kept it strong in Q3 as well. I think it’s been a really good performance today, one to be proud of, and hopefully we can turn it into a top ten finish tomorrow – it would be a great way to wrap up the season. The car has been working well, and we’ve been making the right changes to keep up with the shifting conditions from day to night. It’s never easy, but we found a balance I was really happy with. Now, the goal is to hold our position at the start and try to make our way forward.”\nJonathan Wheatley, Team Principal\n“First of all, I want to apologise to Nico. He was absolutely capable of making it into Q3, but the timing was compromised, which affected his opportunity to progress to Q2.\n“On the other side of the garage, though, it was an incredible performance from Gabi. He delivered exactly what was needed on every lap. It was great to be fighting up there with the front-runners, and he fully earned that outstanding qualifying position. He’s really shown his class today.\n“Looking ahead to tomorrow, we’re starting from a strong place, but our key competitors are all around us. There’s no clear advantage within that group, and our goal is very clearly to outscore Haas and Aston Martin. It’s going to be tougher than we originally expected, but still within our reach. Our focus now is on maximising the opportunities for both cars, doing everything we can to score points and to help Nico recover and get back into the best possible position.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Gabriel Bortoleto of Brazil driving the (5) Kick Sauber C45 Ferrari on track during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Clive Rose/Getty Images)\nHaas\nBearman’s strong form continued into FP3 and Q1, with the Briton looking the pick of the two Haas drivers by far. But after Ocon managed a last-gasp lap to make it out of Q1, he excelled in Q2, pulling a mega lap out of the bag. That landed him in Q3 for the first time since Monaco, while Bearman was left slightly disappointed with P11 after looking in the fight for the third row. But both drivers can fight for points from there, which they need to, with rival Aston Martin having Alonso up the road in sixth.\nEsteban Ocon, 8th, 1:22.913\n“I’m super happy – delighted to say the least. It was honestly the lowest moment of the season yesterday, it was really a bad feeling being half a second away from where we should be. We were lost and changed everything on the car overnight, and the car today feels much better. It’s transformed, and we’re suddenly where we should be, so a big thanks to the team for their continual support. In the tough times, we’ve stuck together, and that makes the difference. It’s a bit late, so there are some regrets there as we could’ve had a lot more points, but we’ll take today, review things, and hopefully it's a good foundation for next year. It’s all to play for tomorrow, we start from the points, and hopefully we convert that.”\nOliver Bearman, 11th, 1:23.041\n“It’s a shame to miss out, but it was a very tight session and every millisecond counted out there tonight. Ultimately, I had a bit of an interrupted qualifying, being on a used set for my first run in Q2, then, as a result, it was a big jump to go onto the new set. The car has the pace, but I just didn’t quite put the lap together. I’m looking forward to the race tomorrow as I think there will be some opportunities, and generally the car has been quick all weekend.”\nAyao Komatsu, Team Principal\n“I’m very happy to get Esteban back up there in qualifying today. He was the best part of half a second off it yesterday, without any obvious issues. Overnight, we made set-up changes to the car, and that worked very well straight away. That was very pleasing and gives the team confidence, and of course it gives lots of confidence to Esteban as well. In Q1, we operated well – using two new sets of tires with Esteban – and although we knew there was a chance of only needing one set with Ollie, the margin was too tight to park it.\n\"In Q2, Esteban did a great job. Ollie’s reference wasn’t a new tire because he kept two new sets of medium tires for the race, which meant he’d have one less set for Q2. He missed getting into Q3 by seven thousandths of a second, and the frustrating thing is you could see the loss in a straight line, so we’re looking into that.\n\"Esteban in Q3 – using one set of used and one set of new softs – did a very good job. It’s very difficult around here to put a perfect lap together, so for us to be frustrated about losing P6 by one hundredth, but being where we were yesterday, we’ve come a long way. The potential is high with this car, and what Ollie has felt all weekend is very good. Tomorrow, we need to get a good start, focus on ourselves, race hard and do the best we can. What will happen, will happen, but I don’t think we can be too hung up on the result, we just need to concentrate on our own race.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Haas F1 VF-25 Ferrari on track during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Hadjar did make Q3 for the team, winding up ninth, and will be targeting points in the final race of his rookie season. Lawson is a few places back but not out of contention for the top 10, especially if the team gamble and split strategies.\nIsack Hadjar, 9th, 1:23.072\n\"It was a decent day today. Compared to yesterday, I’m really happy as I definitely made a step up in my driving, which allowed us to find something special and get to Q3. In Q2, I put it all together and did a very good lap, which unfortunately I couldn’t repeat in Q3 as I didn’t find more grip. I have no regrets as I think P9 was our best possible result today, and we maximised what we had to do in a track that doesn’t suit our car as much as Qatar did. Tomorrow should be a one-stop race, but yesterday we noticed a higher track degradation than expected, so I think we’ll keep having a look at it and we’ll give our best to try and score points.”\nLiam Lawson, 13th, 1:23.077\n\"The car felt quick during Quali, so it's frustrating to be out in Q2. We ended up playing things too conservatively today by using three sets of tyres in Q1, which we didn't need to do. It meant we only had one new set for Q2, resulting in us missing out on Q3 by a small margin. After missing FP1 yesterday, a lot of our data was taken from FP2, which was the first session in the car for me. In hindsight, we were over cautious, so it's something we'll learn from going into next year.”\nGuillaume Dezoteux, Head of Vehicle Performance\n“With the track temperature swinging between afternoon and evening sessions, it’s always difficult here to optimise the cars, assess the performance and relative competitiveness in Free Practice 3. Qualifying was extremely tight, once again. Both cars got through Q1 but the gaps were small, and perfect execution was required to progress in the session. In Q2, we had all 15 cars within 367 milliseconds! Isack went through after a great second lap in new tyres, while Liam got knocked out by less than half a tenth. Finally, in Q3, Isack secured P9 on the grid, extracting everything from the car and the tyres. Our cars are in a good position for the race but our direct competitors are there too. Tomorrow, the tyre management will be key. It’s a long race and we will give everything to finish in the points.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Isack Hadjar of France and Visa Cash App Racing Bulls prepares to drive in the garage during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

They have not been helped by some of their rivals going well here, nor the fact the gaps in the midfield are incredibly tight. As such, Albon exited in Q1 and Sainz in Q2. But with fifth in the championship already secure, those two can race without too much pressure tomorrow and see what happens.\nAlex Albon, 17th, 1:23.416\n\"Difficult session. We couldn’t get the tyres in the right window and hit traffic in the final sector of the lap. There were a few small details which I couldn’t quite nail and, with such a tight field, every millisecond counts. Strategy will make a big difference in the race tomorrow, so it will be interesting to see how each team approaches it. Tomorrow will be tough, but we’ll look to take advantage of any opportunities that come our way.\"\nCarlos Sainz, 12th, 1:23.042\n\"I’m relatively happy with where we are today, as we made a good step from the practice sessions. It was one of the tightest sessions I remember, with only one tenth separating P6-P15 in Q2, and I unfortunately fell short by 0.008 of a second. For tomorrow, it’s looking to be on the limit between a one and a two-stop race, which can result in interesting strategies. I’m confident we can fight to make our way into the points, and the aim is to finish off the 2025 season strong!\"\nJames Vowles, Team Principal\n\"First of all, congratulations to Max. Really impressive laps out there and he was dominant through sector 3. Speaking of which, that was the sector we couldn't quite get right today. The gaps were miniscule. Just a handful of milliseconds separated five cars but that is the state of the sport today and it's brilliant – it is really the highest level of competition we have ever seen, and you have to get absolutely everything perfect. In the case of Carlos today, he was strong everywhere, we just need to review what else we can do to get more performance out of sector 3. With Alex, when the field is this tight, just a tenth punishes you, but he is competitive and I'm confident we can come back fighting tomorrow. These races are unpredictable and we're in the best seat in the house to see what happens on race day.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Twelfth placed qualifier Carlos Sainz of Spain and Williams looks on during qualifying ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

They occupy the back row, with both drivers losing lap times in Q1 to boot after exceeding track limits. In the end Gasly out-qualified Colapinto for the sixth straight race, at the end of a tricky year for the team.\nPierre Gasly, 19th, 1:23.468\n“We did a great job overnight to improve the car and it felt like we made a good step from yesterday. The car was set-up well but today's result is, quite honestly, just a reflection of our performance at this track. It was a very tight Qualifying throughout and we have been on the wrong end of a tenth or two to our competitors across the weekend so far. We had to go for it on the final run on Softs as we had the lap time deletion for track limits on my first run. I was very happy with my final lap, all the corners came together and that was really all we had in our hands. We have the final race of the season tomorrow. It is also the final race with our colleagues from Viry on the power unit side. I am very grateful for everything they have done especially in my Alpine career. We will give it our all for them and see what result we come out with at the end.”\nFranco Colapinto, 20th, 1:23.890\n“The difficulties of yesterday carried over to today unfortunately. I think Pierre found more pace and did a better job than me. We made some changes which made a difference, but I still didn't feel totally comfortable. I felt in a decent place at the start of the weekend, and we need to understand why we haven't been able to make the same improvements across the weekend as others did. We put a lot of pressure on our final lap due to track limits, which was my own doing. There are a few places around the lap where you're right on the limit, and the margins are so tight, you have to push or risk losing time. We need to work hard overnight and give it our best tomorrow. It's an important day for everyone at the team at the final race for Viry, so we'll give it our all to try and give them a nice result.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 06: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A525 Renault leads Andrea Kimi Antonelli of Italy driving the (12) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W16 on track during final practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 06, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

In qualifying, some drivers chose to keep new soft C5 tyres for the quickest laps in the final Q3 session, even though we saw that used softs were still capable of setting fast times after a few cool-down laps.\nLooking at the tyre sets that the teams have kept back for the race, there are two different approaches. McLaren is the only team that has saved two sets of new hards, while most other teams – including Red Bull – have saved two sets of mediums. This shows that teams are keeping the possibility of two stops open, but only McLaren – the winners of the constructors’ championship this year – have gone for the most conservative option.\nThe two quickest strategies tomorrow are one-stoppers. One option is to start on the medium and switch to the hard between laps 20 and 26. An alternative is to start on the hard and then take advantage of the soft’s extra performance by stopping between laps 39 and 45.\nA two-stop strategy seems to be a bit less competitive, especially given the difficulty of overtaking here. The best way to do it is with a combination of medium and hard for the first two stints, followed by a final stint on the medium – which in theory would be quicker for the run to the flag than the hard or the soft under these circumstances.\nIt's not been possible to assess how graining has progressed from the short runs seen today, but there is no evidence of it so far this evening. Track evolution suggests that the situation will be better compared to Friday, especially thanks to the tyre management that we expect from the drivers during the Grand Prix.”"}

He one-stopped to the flag, and had the ability to throw in a free second stop had he wanted to, such was his advantage over the field. That would have enabled Red Bull to enact some gamesmanship to try and swing the title fight his way, but in the end they opted for the victory , knowing the chances of disturbing McLaren’s two drivers was remote at best. As for Tsunoda, he played the team game in his final race for Red Bull, attempting to hold up Norris once the McLaren man pitted. But in doing so he forced Norris wide off the track and received a five-second time penalty for his troubles.\nMax Verstappen, 1st\n“I’m very proud of the whole Team and I’m so proud of the incredible turnaround that we had. We never gave up and always believed we could turn things around and never stopped trying. We could have very easily just have given up, but we kept pushing, looking for improvements and always believed. This season has been a massive rollercoaster, with lots of tough moments and feelings, but I’m so proud of everyone and we have really come together as a Team. The turnaround in the second half of the season was incredible and pretty crazy that we could do that and we kept overcoming a lot of things as a Team. Today has been a lot of fun, especially winning the race in such a dominant way. We had an incredible weekend and did everything as best as we could, so ultimately I feel good today. Although not winning a championship by two points looks painful, going back to Zandvoort we were behind by over 100 points, so am very proud of what we have achieved. Of course, for Lando this is something very special and I hope he enjoys it a lot. The first Championship win is the most emotional one and it is something you dream of since you were a little kid. His family are here and I hope he enjoys tonight with his Team. Finally, I wanted to thank the whole Team in the factory and on track: we never gave up and always believed. I am very proud of the people that I work with, they are my second family.\"\nYuki Tsunoda, 14th\n\"I really tried my absolute best to score points today, and I think there could have been potential to do so, but the penalty made it tricky. We opted for a different strategy, and we were running well until the battle with Lando. I tried to hold him up, but he was pretty fast, and then I ended up with a frustrating penalty. Once I came out for the second stint, it was really challenging to pass. I can look back on this year knowing that I gave it everything until the end. There were lots of times this season where I lacked that bit of luck you sometimes need to make the difference, but that's racing. A big congratulations to Lando—he has been superb all year and drove a solid race tonight to win his first title. Also, congratulations to Max for his victory and an amazing season. Between himself and the Team, they put together a brilliant effort to challenge until the very end and just missed out. He is the best driver on the grid, seeing him work and extract everything that he does is, just shows how good he is, and he has the mentality to go with it, it's very inspiring to see. I'd like to say thank you to the engineers, mechanics, and the entire Team for this season, and I'll still be around next season, so it's not a proper goodbye.\"\nLaurent Mekies, Team Principal\n\"Firstly, congratulations to Lando and McLaren. They have been superb all year and have been our fiercest competitors this season, so a huge well-done to their whole team. It was so tight this year, and we put up a really great fight right to the end, finishing with a dominant display today. We didn’t expect to put in a performance like that around this track, so a big credit to the Team and to Max for getting the car into a position to do exactly that. Starting from pole, we knew the win could be in our hands, and Max was perfect from start to finish, with excellent tyre management to see us through. I’d also like to thank Yuki, who played the team game today, as he did last night, and we thank him for never giving up this season. We simply could not have done anything more. The dominant feeling is one of pride for this sensational turnaround. The effort that every single person in this Team, in the campus and on the race track, has put in is nothing short of incredible. We showed true racing spirit - the Red Bull spirit - right up to the very last lap.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Race winner Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Oracle Red Bull Racing celebrates on arrival in parc ferme during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Neither had the pace to fight with the Red Bull of Verstappen, though, for the win. Piastri on the hard tyres overtook Norris on the opening lap and kept the Dutchman honest, staying out for a long first stint and one-stopping on his way to the flag. Norris had to work harder in the opening stages on the mediums to keep a feisty Leclerc at bay. He mirrored the Ferrari man’s two-stop strategy to ensure he stayed in P3, which was all he needed in the end for that coveted Drivers’ crown.\nLando Norris, 3rd\n\"We did it, World Champion! This is for everyone that's been there for me on this journey. For my family, for my team, and for everyone at McLaren.\n“It's been a tough season, Oscar and Max are incredible competitors and have done an incredible job all year. It's been a privilege to get to race them this year, congratulations to them on their amazing seasons.\n“I'm so proud, not because I'm World Champion, but because of everything those around me have given up to make this possible. Making them happy and rewarding their sacrifices and hard work is what makes me proud.”\nOscar Piastri, 2nd\n\"Congratulations to Lando on the Championship win, it was great to battle with him all the way to the end, and it's a lovely moment for the team. It was a really strong race to finish out this year, we took a risk on strategy, and it paid off, but we just didn't have an answer to Max.\n\"It's been an amazing season and one I am very proud of. We'll take everything we've learnt and head into 2026 as the strongest driver I've ever been. I am excited to see what we can achieve next year.\"\nAndrea Stella, Team Principal\n“Today, we celebrate an extraordinary achievement for the entire McLaren Racing family. The main feeling is that we are incredibly proud to take home a maiden 2025 FIA Formula 1 Drivers’ Championship for Lando. This is a fantastic end to what has been a hard-fought season, one that has tested and brought out the best in everyone across the team. All the men and women in Woking have responded to the call how we had wished to elevate the game and level of performance following our success last season.\n“While only one driver can take the Drivers’ Championship title each season, to be in a situation where both Lando and Oscar were challenging at the sharp end against a four-time World Champion in Max Verstappen, was always an ambition and not a problem. The demand of this was huge, but we did it the McLaren way, even when we had our bumps on in the road, everyone stuck to our culture which showed our incredible unity, and I’m so happy that the team have been rewarded with this success.\n“Lando and Oscar have been outstanding all year both on and off track, showing the true values of what it means to be a McLaren team member. Together they have secured a combined 14 wins and a total of 34 podiums which also delivered the 2025 FIA Formula 1 Constructors’ Championship, our 10th as a team and also our first Championship double since the team’s iconic 1998 season.\n“None of this would be possible without the unwavering support of our shareholders, partners, people, and fans, as well as our long-standing colleagues at HHP who have contributed to another year of successful collaboration.\n“Thank you for being on this journey with us. We’ll make sure we celebrate this moment together before getting our heads down and focusing on the upcoming challenge in 2026.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: 2025 F1 World Drivers Champion Lando Norris of Great Britain and McLaren celebrates with his team during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Bryn Lennon - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\nFerrari\nLeclerc was racy off the line, picking off Russell and giving Norris plenty to think about in the first stint. He ran in DRS range of the McLaren man for lap after lap, but could not find a way through. He was quick in the second and third stints, too, before his charge faded late on and he had to make do with P4. Hamilton started on the softs and climbed right up the order after an early switch to the hard tyre. He was the first to gamble on a two-stop strategy and it paid dividends as he came home in the points despite starting from P16 on the grid.\nCharles Leclerc, 4th\n\"I gave it everything and our team executed the race perfectly. Unfortunately, P4 was all there was in it for us today. I really wanted to finish the season on a high, bringing home a podium for everyone, and I was close to Lando (Norris) in a few moments of the race, but it was not enough to make a pass.\n\"Congratulations to Lando for his first title. He has been doing an incredible job of driving this year and it’s fully deserved.\n\"A huge thank you to our whole team, both at the track and at home in Italy, for all the hard work put in this year, as well as our Tifosi for their ongoing support. It’s been a tough season for us.\n\"Next season is still a blank slate, and we don’t know where the other teams stand, so we don’t have any real expectations yet. After this week, we will head back to Maranello to regroup, and our job will be to focus all our efforts on preparing for the season ahead as best as we can.\"\nLewis Hamilton, 8th\n\"I’m pleased with today’s drive. We made good progress, overtook a lot of cars, and got ourselves back into the points. The two-stop strategy worked well so thank you to the team.\n\"It’s been a tough season, but the kindness and hard work of everyone at Ferrari means a lot to me. I stand with team and know we have better times ahead. After testing, I’m looking forward to taking some time to switch off, spend time with my family and friends and will come back refreshed and stronger in January.\n\"Congratulations to Lando. It’s great to see a fellow Brit win the championship. I’m proud of the work he’s put in over the years and this result is fully deserved.\"\nFred Vasseur, Team Principal\n\"First of all congratulations to Lando on winning the title. Ever since his days in karting it was obvious that he has a special talent and this title is well deserved and well done also to McLaren for giving him the equipment to get the job done.\n\"Overall, this has not been a bad weekend for us in terms of pure performance, but it came a bit too late following a very tough start on Friday after which the team at the track and back in the factory did a very good job to recover for Saturday, by making very big changes to the cars. However, when you have to recover like this, it’s all about fine tuning the details and we weren’t able to do that. That affected our qualifying as the field was so close and then today our race pace was good and with Charles we were matching Lando’s pace, but in the current F1 where the gaps are so small, if you leave anything on the table you pay the price. Lewis also had a good race with very strong pace, he pulled off some nice overtaking moves and the motivation was there. But across the whole team, if we want better results we must work on having better weekends from the start of practice.\n\"I want to thank everyone in the team at the track and all the people back in Maranello for all their hard work all year and of course thanks also to the Tifosi for their support this season, because even when we were struggling, and we had some very tough weekends, they were always behind us, always supportive and you can’t imagine the positive energy this has given us throughout all the year.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Charles Leclerc of Monaco driving the (16) Scuderia Ferrari SF-25 on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by James Sutton - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\nMercedes\nRussell had plenty of wheelspin off the line, and dropped behind Leclerc and Alonso which was far from ideal. He managed to pick off the Aston Martin man, but could not get the Ferrari ahead. As such, he stopped early to try the undercut, which very nearly worked. But he lost pace in the last stint and came home a distant fifth - which was more than enough to secure P2 in the Constructors’ for Mercedes. As for Antonelli , he started on the hard tyre but could not quite make that strategy play out after getting stuck in a DRS train for much of the race.\nGeorge Russell, 5th\n\"That was a very tough race for us this evening. We struggled to find the pace that would threaten those ahead throughout the whole Grand Prix. I had a poor start and dropped down to P6; I got back ahead of Alonso to take P5, but it was a lonely night from there. We knew in normal circumstances that we likely didn’t have the pace to challenge for the podium, but it was still frustrating.\n\"Whilst the season didn’t end in the way we wanted, we can be pleased that we secured P2 in the Constructors’. It has been a challenging four years in this ground effect era for us as a team and getting P2 was definitely our aim from after the summer break. We’ve ticked that box but ultimately, we want more than this and that is what we are fully focused on delivering in 2026 with the seismic rules change.\n\"Finally, I want to wish congratulations to Lando (Norris) as he becomes World Champion. We’ve raced together for so long and he is more than deserving of the title. Hopefully we can do battle on track next year for the 2026 crown!\"\nKimi Antonelli, 15th\n\"I struggled with the balance of the car this evening and didn’t have the pace to get back into the points sadly. It was a tough night and a difficult race and that is unfortunate. We’d enjoyed a good run of Grands Prix up to that point but that’s racing sometimes. We’ve got some work to do with the test on Tuesday and our full focus is already on 2026.\n\"It’s been quite a journey this season. It’s not the way we wanted to end the year, but the most important thing is that we brought home P2 in the Constructors’ Championship. Happily, we were able to do that. Over the winter, we will look back over the season, see where we could have done better, and come back much stronger.\n\"Congratulations to Lando (Norris) too. He deserves it but also well done to both Max (Verstappen) and Oscar (Piastri) who have also been brilliant this year. It was a great battle all year.\"\nToto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport\n\"Congratulations firstly to Lando Norris on winning the World Championship. He is a worthy winner; I am really happy for him and everyone that is close to him. His parents will be quite rightly proud of his achievement, and I am sure they will enjoy it. Congratulations also to Zak (Brown) and Andrea (Stella); they have done a great job at McLaren to secure both titles this year.\n\"Our race can be summed up in one word: mediocre. It was a lonely one for George who wasn’t threatened from behind but didn’t have the pace of the front four cars. He was managing his tyres to bring the car home on the one-stop, and he did that successfully. For Kimi, he tried his best from a difficult starting position, but we just didn’t have the speed in the car to enable him to get back into the points. It is not the way we wanted to end the year, but we can be pleased we secured P2 in the Constructors’. Since the midpoint of the season, that has been our aim. It is not what we as Mercedes ultimately want to be fighting for though and hopefully, we can prove ourselves worthy of being in a world title fight next year.\"\nAndrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director\n\"That was an underwhelming way to end our season. We came into the race hoping to fight for the podium with George and to help Kimi battle back into a solid points scoring position. Unfortunately, we didn't have the pace today to do that and had to bear a frustrating evening. Both drivers lost places at the start and things didn't improve much from there. George was in no man's land between the top four and the rest of the field. He drove sensibly to bring the car home P5. For Kimi, he needed a good start and a strong car to recover from qualifying and unfortunately did not have either.\n\"We're pleased to have secured second place in the Constructors’ Championship in an entertaining, season long battle with Ferrari and Red Bull, we go into the winter very mindful that McLaren won this championship comfortably. We look forward to the immense challenge of the new regulations; we've been working hard on the W17 for a long time and will redouble our efforts across the winter in a bid to get back to winning ways.\n\"Finally, well done to Lando. He drove brilliantly in the final races and is a worthy champion.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Andrea Kimi Antonelli of Italy driving the (12) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W16 leads George Russell of Great Britain driving the (63) Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team W16 on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Although he dropped back, he managed to keep the rest of the midfield at bay. Pitting with the top runners, Alonso remained competitive throughout to secure sixth place and seventh in the championship for Aston Martin. As for Stroll , he ran a very long first stint on the hard tyre. When he eventually pitted, he was quick on the mediums and overtook Bortoleto late on to climb into the points. He finished ninth, was demoted to P11 when a time penalty was applied for changing direction too many times… only for Bearman to receive a time penalty himself, which promoted Stroll back to the points.\nFernando Alonso, 6th\n\"It is great to finish the season with a strong P6 here in Abu Dhabi. Our race pace hasn't always matched our qualifying recently, so a solid Sunday here feels very good. It's been a challenging year, and I want to thank the whole team for their hard work all season. We'll enjoy a break, then switch our focus to preparing for the big changes next year. And congratulations to Lando on his first World Championship; it is a special moment for any young driver, and he deserves it.\"\nLance Stroll, 10th\n\"It was a fun race, some great overtakes and good strategy by the team today, and nice to pick up a point at the final race at Yas Marina Circuit. In hindsight, we could've maybe pitted a lap or two earlier and finished even further up in the points. This year has been a tough one for the team, we haven't been as competitive as we wanted to be, so finishing this season with a positive result and P7 in the Constructors' Championship is good.\"\nMike Krack, Chief Trackside Officer\n\"Firstly, congratulations to McLaren and Lando for a well-deserved end to their season. For us, it was great to complete the final race of 2025 on a positive note, with a double-points finish.\n\"Fernando drove a great race, finishing in P6 and bringing home eight valuable points for the team. Lance also had an excellent race, managing the Hard tyre well and pulling off a series of decisive overtakes. He climbed six positions before a post-race time penalty dropped him to P10.\n\"We finish the season P7 in the Constructors' Championship.

He even kept a charging Hamilton at bay for the last chunk of the race to record his best result since Monaco. As for Bearman , he was on the fringes of the points in the closing stages but received a five-second time penalty for more than one change of direction in a battle with Stroll, which ended any chance of finishing his rookie season in the top 10.\nEsteban Ocon, 7th\n“I’m very happy to finish the year this way. I think it was a really strong race from our side, and it was the maximum that we could’ve done. We fought with Fernando Alonso the whole race, it was definitely a big fight as he was matching my middle sector, it was really close, and there was a lot of overtaking all the way to the end. It wasn't quite enough to finish ahead of Aston Martin in the Constructors’ Championship. It’s a bittersweet taste, but it’s definitely a good last race that gives us a solid platform to build on next year.\"\nOliver Bearman, 12th\n“Overall, it was a good race. We pitted on the early side, but we managed to hold others off. To get penalized for more than one change of direction with Stroll – I broke the tow once, which is allowed by regulation, and then I defended the inside line for the rest of the straight. I’m looking forward to the winter break now, we built really strong foundations for this year, and that’s positive, and thanks once again to the whole team for everything this year.”\nAyao Komatsu, Team Principal\n“At the start of the day, we aimed to get both cars into the points. We achieved it until Ollie’s penalty – which I thought was really harsh, however – that’s the rule. To cross the line in P7 and P10 is a really good job from everyone, as we started from P8 and P11. We raced really hard, really well, and there was huge pressure trying to get P7 in the Constructors’ Championship, but everyone stayed calm. The pit stops were good, especially the second one, but I knew we’d bounce back – that team has done a great job this year, ending on a high.\n\"We couldn’t quite reach our target of beating Aston Martin today, but those championship positions don’t happen over one race, that happens over the course of 24 races. I’m very happy to say we should be proud of ourselves, how we improved this year and scored 79 points. Last year we finished P7 on 58 points, but this year the competition is so much tighter, and in the last seven races, we scored in six of them. It’s amazing that we’ve improved the cars two years in a row and finished the season on a high, it gives us confidence going into next year. I want to say thank you to everyone in this team, you should be proud of yourselves, and this is an achievement from everyone. I’m very happy to be working with this group of people, I couldn’t be prouder.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Haas F1 VF-25 Ferrari on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

But once he pitted for fresh rubber, the Brazilian got bogged down in the midfield. Hulkenberg was on a different strategy, after starting on the softs and pitting early. Despite some contact with Gasly, he managed to climb up the order and was running close to his team mate late on. Bortoleto lost out to Stroll who was on much fresher tyres and finished out of the points, but Hulkenberg gained a position when the Canadian’s penalty was applied, to ensure Kick Sauber earned some points in their last race before becoming Audi.\nNico Hulkenberg, 9th\n“Scoring two points, after a disappointing Saturday and coming from P18, is definitely something I am very, very pleased with. It’s not easy to move forward through the field here, especially when everyone is roughly on the same race pace. So all things considered, I’m very happy with P9 – it's a good way to end the last race of the season. It’s also a nice way to say goodbye to Sauber — Peter has such a legacy, he’s been in the industry so long and I have big respect for what he’s achieved.\n“I think it was definitely a good season — a lot of positive things happened. We developed, evolved and grew as a team, and we put in a couple of really good highlights. The podium was nice to finally tick off my shoulder; I was very happy about that. Barcelona, Budapest, Monza, Austin — many really strong weekends, and of course a few where we didn’t maximise everything, but that’s the challenge in a long season. All in all, I think we can be relatively satisfied. We’ll digest the season now, enjoy the break, and then look ahead to the new chapter that is waiting for us.”\nGabriel Bortoleto, 11th\n“I'm not going to lie – it's a bit disappointing to have finished just outside of the points today. Unfortunately, we struggled with bouncing from the first lap, and I don’t think we maximised our race as we should have. It’s a shame, because the car felt amazing yesterday and I really felt we could have scored some points today. Looking back at my first Formula One season, it’s been a special year for me with several good results and strong quali sessions, so there's definitely lots to be proud of – I couldn't have done this without the support of the team. It was a good and valuable year. The season is in the books now and I am looking forward to our future.  I'm already keen to start working on next year and hopefully fight for bigger things.”\nJonathan Wheatley, Team Principal\n“First, I want to extend my congratulations to Lando on securing his first championship. It was an incredible showdown and a fantastic spectacle to watch from the pit wall.\n“Although there is a sense of disappointment today, it comes at the end of what has been an extraordinary season. We have experienced highs and lows, and ultimately scored points well beyond our initial expectations. To finish with 70 points and only place P9 in the Constructors’ Championship is unprecedented and shows what a close season this has been.\n“Today once again highlighted the unpredictability of our year. We think a car issue resulted in Gabi lacking pace and, in hindsight, an earlier swap to the two-stop strategy with Nico would have been advantageous, especially given his pace in the closing stages. This is something we will review as we continue learning and improving.\n“One consistent positive has been the performance and spirit of the pit crew, who, again, delivered solid performance in the pit lane. The progress this team has made this year is significant and provides us with real momentum heading into 2026.\n“And finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Peter Sauber for his remarkable legacy and for shaping the team we are so proud to represent. As we move toward becoming the Audi Formula 1 Team in 2026, we do so with optimism, determination, and a clear sense of purpose.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Gabriel Bortoleto of Brazil driving the (5) Kick Sauber C45 Ferrari leads Nico Hulkenberg of Germany driving the (27) Kick Sauber C45 Ferrari on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

He’s taken a big step forward this year, risen to the pressure and his title is well-deserved.\n\"For us, it was a tricky race today. We had a great start, but we were never in a place where we had the tyre advantage, which meant we were stuck in a bit of a train.\n\"The last few races have been tough, but overall, it’s been a great season for us. I’m proud of the team and proud to finish top of the midfield. There’s no big secret behind it; just hard work, good leadership from James, and building some strong foundations. We’ve come a long way this season, and we’re heading into 2026 with a lot of optimism and a great mentality. I’m confident we can do great things next year, so I’m already excited to get back on track in 2026!\"\nCarlos Sainz, 13th\n\"We haven’t been strong all weekend and today was a normal race with not much going on. We committed to a one-stop strategy and got stuck in a train of DRS, so there was little to do from there with the pace we had.\n\"More importantly, looking at the season as a whole, it’s one to be proud of! I’ve stuck to my way of doing things, improved progressively throughout the year together with the team and, overall, we finished in good form. Fifth in the Constructors’ Championship was an ambitious target, and we got it, so I’m incredibly happy.\n\"We need to stay hungry and continue to push all together. We have built solid foundations for next year but there is always margin for improvement. Thanks to the entire team for their effort and to every single one of our fans out there, your support means everything to us!\n\"Last but not least, a massive congratulations to Lando on his first Drivers’ Championship! He’s an incredible driver and he has proven that you can achieve your highest goals staying true to yourself! Congrats my muppet friend! Well deserved!\"\nJames Vowles, Team Principal\n\"First and foremost, congratulations to Lando on a well-deserved Championship. For us, this marks the end of a really successful 2025. In a couple of days, we'll be testing here in Abu Dhabi in preparation for 2026 and, in just a few weeks' time, the 2026 car will be a reality and I can't wait. This is a good moment to say thank you to everyone that has been behind us for not just this year but for many years. It's the start of our journey and I can't wait for what's next. Thank you very much.\"\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Carlos Sainz of Spain and Williams on the grid during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Lawson was penalised for erratic driving and earned himself a five-second time penalty for his troubles. With neither car scoring, Racing Bulls just held onto P6 in the championship by three points.\nIsack Hadjar, 17th\n\"It was a very tough Sunday. We haven’t had enough pace the whole weekend to fight for our usual positions, and yesterday it was a surprise for me to put the car in P9. We started in the points, but we knew it would have been difficult for us to maintain that place. Looking at the positives and reflecting on my first F1 season, it’s been a great journey and I’m proud of everyone within VCARB for everything we achieved together. It’s not the final race we wanted but getting P6 in the Constructors’ Championship was our target and a great reward for all of us.”\nLiam Lawson, 18th\n“Congratulations to the team on P6 in the Constructors'. While we struggled with our strategy and pace today, we've had a strong season and achieved our target this weekend. I'm excited to get back to work after the short winter break. Next year will be a big opportunity with the team which I'm very excited and grateful for.\"\nAlan Permane, Team Principal\n“Today brings an end to a long season, but a really really great season for Racing Bulls. Sixth place in the Championship is amazing; we’ve only ever reached P6 once before, so it’s a huge achievement. It’s truly a testament to the commitment, passion and hard work within this team, both at the track and back at the factory. Each and every person can be really proud of themselves. There have been ups and downs all the way through and it really went down to the wire with Aston Martin but I’m incredibly happy.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Isack Hadjar of France driving the (6) Visa Cash App Racing Bulls VCARB 02 leads Carlos Sainz of Spain driving the (55) Williams FW47 Mercedes on track during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Starting from the back, both cars two-stopped as they tried to make progress up the field. But they have not had the pace here all weekend, and ultimately propped up the order. Gasly beat his team mate despite receiving a five-second time penalty for track limit infringements and having contact with the Kick Sauber of Hulkenberg, while Colapinto’s P20 meant the Argentine did not get a point on the board in 2025.\nPierre Gasly, 19th\n“It was not a great race to end the season and there really is not a lot to say other than we tried our best but our pace was just not enough to really challenge. Looking back at the year as a whole, as a team, we can still take a lot from the season. I have been really impressed with how the team has handled a tough year where we have not been competitive. Despite its challenges, everyone has given their all and shown a really great mentality which we can take forwards to next year, so thank you to everyone trackside, at Enstone and at Viry for all their efforts this year. We have a lot of belief in the 2026 project and I am definitely looking forward to a clean slate and a fresh start for everyone. Finally, congratulations to Lando [Norris] on winning the title. It was a close one with Max [Verstappen] and Oscar [Piastri] and any of them could have taken it. For it to be decided by just two points is great for Formula One, so well done to all three, Lando managed to get it done and it's a big moment for him. One day we hope to be in that position and we will continue to work hard to hopefully one day do just that.”\nFranco Colapinto, 20th\n“It was a long and difficult race and, ultimately, we lacked pace all weekend. It's been a tricky stretch of races, and we haven't had the results we were expecting. It has been a tough end to the year, but everyone has kept pushing to the very end. It's a year we'd like to put behind us but learn and come back stronger from. Thanks to the entire team for their efforts this year in difficult circumstances. There's still a few weeks to push at the factory and wrap things up before the holidays. After that, it will be time to rest and reset for what will be an important year for myself and the team. Finally, congratulations to Lando [Norris]. He's had a great year and is a deserving champion.”\nFlavio Briatore, Executive Advisor\n“Today's result probably summarises our season where the car has not been competitive enough. It has been a long and often tough season for everyone at the team. I know everyone is eager and motivated to put this campaign behind us and very much ready to push tirelessly to make the next one more of a success. Congratulations to McLaren and Lando Norris on winning both championships. Their level this year has been extraordinary and they have been the benchmark in Formula One this season. For now, the hard work doesn't stop as we look ahead to a better 2026.”\n1 / 2\nABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Alpine F1 A525 Renault  during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Mark Thompson/Getty Images)\nPirelli\nMario Isola, Motorsport Director\n“Congratulations to Lando Norris on winning his first drivers’ title. The battle went all the way to the final round of the season – which was one of the most closely-fought of the last few years thanks to the similarly competitive pace of the different teams. Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri certainly didn’t hold back today, giving us a thrilling final.\nIn terms of strategy, the majority of the teams opted for a one-stopper using the most consistent two compounds as we expected: in some cases, stretching the hard tyre stint for more than 40 laps.  Even though there was no graining on the hardest compound, there were still inevitably some signs of wear in the final laps.\nAmong the drivers choosing the alternative strategy, the newly crowned champion Lando Norris stands out. He went for a two-stopper, probably prompted by the extra pit stop for Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, using the two fresh sets of hard tyres that McLaren had saved in their build-up to the race.\nFerrari’s Lewis Hamilton also used a fresh set of tyres for his final stint, which in this case was the medium. This excellent choice allowed him to make up several places, underlining how close the two strategic options were, as shown by our simulations.\nPirelli’s job does not stop here: we will be back on track on Tuesday together with all the teams for a full test day, A total of 10 mule cars piloted by the race drivers will try out the new 2026 tyre range, while 10 young drivers will take to the track with this year’s cars and tyres.”"}

It meant the Silver Arrows finished 18 points ahead of Red Bull – but while team boss Toto Wolff was pleased, he was not over the moon with the race itself.\nRussell started fourth but lost places off the line courtesy of some wheelspin, and from there struggled for pace and could not catch up to the back of Charles Leclerc ahead to challenge for fourth or even the rostrum.\nKimi Antonelli had an even more frustrating race down the order, finishing well out of the points in 15th place. But Russell’s points were enough to ensure Mercedes ended the season with that P2 in the Teams’ Championship , despite Max Verstappen winning the race for Red Bull.\n“Our race can be summed up in one word: mediocre. It was a lonely one for George who wasn’t threatened from behind but didn’t have the pace of the front four cars,” Wolff explained.\n“He was managing his tyres to bring the car home on the one-stop, and he did that successfully. For Kimi, he tried his best from a difficult starting position, but we just didn’t have the speed in the car to enable him to get back into the points.\n“It is not the way we wanted to end the year, but we can be pleased we secured P2 in the Constructors’. Since the midpoint of the season, that has been our aim.”\nMcLaren were runaway winners of the Championship, scoring 833 points to Mercedes’ 469. It leaves Mercedes without a Constructors’ crown since 2021, but they did at least improve on last season’s fourth-place finish.\n“It is not what we as Mercedes ultimately want to be fighting for though, and hopefully we can prove ourselves worthy of being in a world title fight next year,” Wolff concluded.\nMercedes can at least point to the fact that Russell took two wins in a season dominated by McLaren and Verstappen as a positive, along with the introduction of rookie Antonelli to a full-time race seat, with the teenager having some standout performances towards the end of the year and taking three podiums.\nBut with the regulations set to change for 2026, it remains to be seen if Mercedes will start the next era as strong as they did with the dawn of the turbo-hybrid era in 2014."}

We’ve raced together for so long and he is more than deserving of the title. Hopefully we can do battle on track next year for the 2026 crown!\"\n\"Congratulations to Lando too,\" his Mercedes team mate Kimi Antonelli said. \"He deserves it but also well done to both Max and Oscar Piastri who have also been brilliant this year. It was a great battle all year.\"\nCarlos Sainz, Norris' former team mate at the Woking outfit, also shared a compilation of the years they've spent competing against each other in F1, captioning the Instagram post: \"Massive congratulations to @lando on his first Drivers’ Championship! He’s an incredible driver and he has proven that you can achieve your highest goals staying true to yourself! Congrats my muppet friend! Well deserved!\"\nSpeaking after the race, the Spaniard told Sky Sports F1 : \"I'm very happy for him as a driver because I think he's always been an extremely quick driver, quicker than people give him credit for, and extremely talented since I worked with him at McLaren. I saw a guy that had the speed to be a multiple World Champion if it was purely down to speed.\n\"I think along the way he's developed a lot of his skills and now he's World Champion. More than anything, I'm happy for him as a person because I think he's a driver that doesn't follow the typical stereotype of a World Champion.\n\"I think he's always stayed very true to himself, very honest, very open about his own struggles. He's just proven to everyone that you can also be World Champion being a good guy and that open. You don't need to be ruthless or badass to show to everyone that you can be World Champion so I'm happy for him.\"\nAs the fireworks went off over the Yas Marina Circuit, Hamilton walked into Norris' post-race interview to say \"I told you!\" with a grin in a heartwarming moment, with both drivers now able to call themselves champions with McLaren.\nThere were also words of congratulations from Norris' 2025 title rivals, with Verstappen hoping the Briton enjoys the moment.\n\"Winning your first title is something that I think we all dreamt of when you get into the sport,\" the four-time World Champion said. \"You work for that since you're a little kid. It’s what you dream of.\n\"So, when you win your first title, this is very emotional. And, yeah, I hope for Lando as well. You know, I saw a lot of his family is here, so it’s important to enjoy this a lot as well tonight. Also, with his team.\n\"I think, again, that’s another story where it showed that even when you have tough years, when you keep working hard, you keep adding good people to the team, you can overcome all of those things, and you can become very successful again. And, yeah, they had an incredible season together, so it’s important that they enjoy it.\"\nAs for Norris' team mate and fellow title rival Piastri, who had led the championship himself for large portions of the season, the Australian also had nothing but words of praise for the new champion.\n\"I think a very deserving winner,\" he said when asked to give his thoughts on Norris' achievement. \"I know that every weekend I go on track, it’s going to be tough. And I think we’ve pushed each other through the last three years.\n\"I think, especially this season, [it] has been tighter than ever. So, yeah, I think he’s had a great season. Probably all three of us, but obviously, myself and Lando in the same team, in the same car, have had our ups and downs at different moments. Ultimately, I think he’s had a good season and a deserving champion.\""}
